     Is Marijuana Dangerous to your Physical Health?
  Recreational use of marijuana has been going on for many
years, and like cigarettes many people refuse to listen to health
reports.  More and more reports are coming out on the effects of
marijuana on the body.  Just how harmful marijuana can be is
questionable.  Some health reports state that it is very
detrimental to the body while others are explaining how chemicals
extracted from the marijuana plant are being used as medication. 
The problem is, just what are the effects, and how bad is it for
someone who uses this drug?
     I have picked this topic because I am very interested in the
effects of marijuana on the body.  It is commonly known that
marijuana is a widely used drug.  Many movies depict people
having a great time, smoking marijuana, and laughing as hard as
they can.  But is this really what is behind the drug?  Without
looking at health reports, one may think so.  If so many people
use it, how can it be bad for you?  After seeing so much positive
feedback about marijuana, it would really be nice to see just
what is behind this mysterious plant.
     In this paper, the researcher will explore whether or not
marijuana is harmful to your physical health.  It will be shown
that marijuana is popular and that many people may not know what
they are taking into their bodies.  It will be shown just what
parts of the body marijuana effects and how it effects them.  The
main purpose of this collection of information is to see just
what marijuana does to the body and to determine whether the
effects are good, bad, or a combination of both.  Many different
areas of research will be used.
     The report "Marijuana Retains Popularity Despite Anti-drug
Attitudes" in The Dallas Times Herald by the Associated Press
shows just how popular marijuana remains despite health warnings. 
A 40-something woman referred to as Ruth has a little something
to say.  "It's a very nice high," she said.  "Often in these drug
stories, people forget to mention that part" (The Associated
Press, A-6).  Ruth is among the 17 million Americans who use
marijuana regularly.  Part of the reason for marijuana's
popularity is its cheap price.  John, a scientist who uses the
drug says an ounce can cost him from $40 to $100 (The Associated
Press, A-6).  Another reason for its popularity that is  that
"the cops basically ignored it" a few years ago, said Bill
FitzGerald, of the County Attorney's Office  (The Associated
Press, A-6).  Today, the county boasts a "Do Drugs, Do Time"
program targeting all drug users (The Associated Press, A-6). 
     "Marijuana:  Is there a new reason to worry?", an article in
the March 88 issue of American Health by Winifred Gallagher had a
lot to say about just what parts of the body marijuana effects. 
The majority of the effects of marijuana are caused by a chemical
called THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol).  Marijuana, when
smoked, enters the body though the lungs and is passed to the
blood stream.  According to Doctor Billy martin, a professor of
pharmacology at the Medical College of Virginia, THC seems to
turn on a number of biological systems  (Gallagher, 92). 
Harvard's Dr. Norman Zinberg studied a group of marijuana smoker
and concluded that "essentially, marijuana doesn't cause
psychological problems for the occasional user" (Gallagher, 92). 
Heavy use however, is thought to create a lack of motivation, or
commonly called "burn-out".  New York Hospital's Millman prefers 
the term "aberrant motivation" to describe the inert attitude of
some heavy smokers" (Gallagher, 92).
     "The Health Hazards of Marijuana," a report in the September
1990 issue of World & I by Gabriel G. Nahas was very informative
on the damage caused by marijuana. Marijuana effects memory and
behavior.  "Marijuana really interferes with short-term memory,"
says Dr. Richard Schwartz or Georgetown University, and memory
loss is one of the main problems with kids who smoke pot" (Nahas,
287).  Marijuana also effects the immune system.  Guy Cabral of
the Medical College of Virginia reported that THC impairs the
competence of calls to destroy virus infected cells and tumor
cells (Nahas, 293).  Marijuana also has devastating effects on
human mental development, and cause metal disorders.
     An article in Science News on February 20, 1988 by Rick
Weiss called "Take Two Puffs and Call Me in the Morning" had
something completely different to say.  In the U.S., scientists
have discovered that marijuana can ease the nausea from
chemotherapy in cancer patients.  "Marijuana's use in reducing
nausea appears to be quite widespread..." (Weiss, 123). 
Marijuana is also in use by people who suffer from glaucoma. 
"Marijuana lowers the pressure that build up behind the eyes as a
result of having glaucoma" (Weiss, 122).  It was also discovered
that there are several receptor sites in the brain that control
motor functions, learning and memory.  Hence, marijuana may be
useful in treating a problem in many of those areas.
     Based on the information gathered, I have concluded that the
effects of marijuana on the body are very detrimental. 
Marijuana's effects on memory and the immune system can be very
disastrous.  For someone still in school, a good memory is
needed, along with much motivation.  Marijuana attacks both of
these elements in the body and can really hurt a hard working
student.
     It seems however, most of the complications that were
brought up occur mostly in heavy, chronic users.  I am sure that
along with these complications, the same complications as with
cigarette smoking come up.  Occasional use of marijuana doesn't
seem to cause many problems.  However, as with any drug, the user
can become accustomed to its use and not be able to function
properly.  So even occasional use can lead to disaster.
     Marijuana effects many different parts of the body in many
ways.  Being that marijuana is fat-soluble, it can remain in the
body for over 4-weeks after use.  Researchers are unable to
determine what the chemicals are doing to the body while they
remain there over this period of time.  This just proves that
there is much more research to be done, and that in the future it
may be seen that marijuana is much more dangerous than even shown
in this paper.
     As for using marijuana as medicine, I think the same goes as
above.  A lot more research has to be done on the side effects of
THC before any real use can be done.  There have been many drugs
up to now that have seemed useful, but in the end have caused
more harm to the body than good.

                       Health Implications
     I think that marijuana use effects myself and my peers very
much.  As I go to parties and the such, it can be seen that drug
use is around, no one can deny it.  Its scary to see just what
some people are doing to themselves, and they don't even know it.
     I think that if some of the marijuana users took some time
to read this, and many of the other reports on the effects of
marijuana, they would think twice before lighting up next time. 
Maybe they will wonder just what harm they have done to their
body already.
     Many people that smoke marijuana have the effects that are
discussed in this paper.  Its can plainly be seen, their lack of
motivation and kind of "spaceyness" that is commonly associated
with marijuana smoking.  I often wonder what these people would
be like if they stopped their use and allowed themselves to rid
their body of the THC and its by-products.
     Marijuana use is still very popular throughout the United
States, and the fact that people are not educated enough about
its effects is very detrimental.  These people are hurting
themselves, and they don't know (and many just don't care) what
they are doing to their bodies.  If marijuana use was to grow too
much, we may have a country of unmotivated people, with many more
health problems due to their immune deficiencies.  Where will we
be then?
	The debate over the legalization of Cannabis sativa, more
commonly known as marijuana, has been one of the most heated
controversies ever to occur in the United States.  Its use as a
medicine has existed for thousands of years in many countries
world wide and is documented as far back as 2700 BC in ancient
Chinese writings.  When someone says ganja, cannabis, bung,
dope, grass, rasta, or weed, they are  talking about the same
subject:  marijuana.  Marijuana should be legalized because the
government could earn money from taxes on its sale, its value to
the medical world outweighs its abuse potential, and because of
its importance to the paper and clothing industries.  This action
should be taken despite efforts made by groups which say
marijuana is a harmful drug which will increase crime rates and
lead users to other more dangerous substances.
	The actual story behind the legislature passed against
marijuana is quite surprising.  According to Jack Herer, author of
The Emperor  Wears No Clothes, the acts bringing about the
demise of hemp were part of a large conspiracy involving DuPont,
Harry J. Anslinger, commissioner of the Federal Bureau of
Narcotics (FBN), and many other influential industrial leaders
such as William Randolph Hearst and Andrew Mellon.  Herer
notes that the Marijuana Tax Act, which passed in 1937,
coincidentally occurred just as the decoricator machine was
invented.  With this invention, hemp would have been able to
take over competing industries almost instantaneously. 
According to Popular Mechanics, "10,000 acres devoted to hemp
will produce as much paper as 40,000 acres of average [forest]
pulp land." William Hearst owned enormous timber acreage so his
interest in preventing the growth of hemp can be easily explained. 
Competition from hemp would have easily driven the Hearst
paper-manufacturing company out of business and significantly
lowered the value of his land.  Herer even suggests popularizing
the term "marijuana" was a strategy Hearst used in order to create
fear in the American public.  Herer says "The first step in creating
hysteria was to introduce the element of fear of the unknown by
using a word that no one had ever heard of before... 'marijuana'".
	DuPont's involvement in the anti-hemp campaign can also
be explained with great ease.  At this time, DuPont was patenting
a new sulfuric acid process for producing wood-pulp paper. 
According to the company's own records, wood-pulp products
ultimately accounted for more than 80% of all DuPont's railroad
car loadings for the 50 years the Marijuana Tax Act was passed.  It
should also be said that two years before the prohibitive hemp tax
in 1937, DuPont developed nylon which was a substitute for hemp
rope.  The year after the tax was passed DuPont came out with
rayon, which would have been unable to compete with the
strength of hemp fiber or its  economical process of
manufacturing.  "DuPont's point man was none other than Harry
Anslinger...who was appointed to the FBN by Treasury Secretary
Andrew  Mellon, who was also chairman of the Mellon Bank,
DuPont's chief financial backer.  Anslinger's relationship to
Mellon wasn't just political, he was also married to Mellon's niece" 
(Hartsell).  
	The reasoning behind DuPont, Anslinger, and Hearst was
not for any moral or health related issues.  They fought to prevent
the growth of this new industry so they wouldn't lose money.  In
fact, the American Medical Association tried to argue for the
medical benefits of hemp.  Marijuana is actually less dangerous
than alcohol, cigarettes, and even most over-the-counter
medicines or prescriptions.  According to Francis J. Young, the
DEA's administrative judge, "nearly all medicines have toxic,
potentially lethal affects, but marijuana is not such a
substance...Marijuana, in its natural form, is one of the safest
therapeutically active substances known to man.  By any measure
of rational analysis marijuana can be safely used within a
supervised routine of medical care"  (DEA Docket No. 86-22, 57). 
It doesn't make sense then, for marijuana to be illegal in the
United States  when alcohol poisoning is a major cause of death
in this country and approximately 400,000 premature deaths are
attributed to cigarettes annually.  Dr. Roger Pertwee, Secretary of
the International Cannabis Research Society states that as a
recreational drug, "Marijuana compares favorably to nicotine,
alcohol, and even caffeine."  Under extreme amounts of alcohol a
person will experience an "inability to stand or walk without help,
stupor and near unconsciousness, lack of comprehension of what
is seen or heard, shock, and breathing and heartbeat may stop." 
Even though these effects occur only under an extreme amount of
alcohol consumption, (.2-.5 BAL) the fact is smoking extreme
amounts of marijuana will do nothing more than put you to sleep,
while drinking excessive amounts of alcohol will kill you.
	The most profound activist for marijuana's use as a
medicine is Dr. Lester Grinspoon, author of Marihuana:  The
Forbidden Medicine. According to Grinspoon, "The only well
confirmed negative effect of marijuana is caused by the smoke,
which contains three times more tars and five times more carbon
monoxide than tobacco.  But even the heaviest marijuana smokers
rarely use as much as an average tobacco smoker.  And, of course,
many prefer to eat it."  His book includes personal accounts of
how prescribed marijuana alleviated epilepsy, weight loss of AIDs,
nausea of chemotherapy, menstrual pains, and the severe effects
of Multiple Sclerosis.  The illness with the most documentation
and harmony among doctors which marijuana has successfully
treated is MS.  Grinspoon believes for MS sufferers, "Cannabis is
the drug of necessity."  One patient of his, 51 year old Elizabeth
MacRory, says "It has completely changed my life...It has helped
with muscle spasms, allowed me to sleep properly, and helped
control my bladder."  Marijuana also proved to be effective in the
treatment of glaucoma because its use lowers pressure on the eye. 
	"In a recent survey at a leading teaching hospital, 'over 60
per cent of medical students were found to be marijuana users.' 
In the same survey, only 30 per cent admitted to smoking
cigarettes"  (Guardian).  Brian Hilliard, editor of Police Review,
says "Legalizing cannabis wouldn't do any harm to anybody.  We
should be concentrating on the serious business of heroin and
amphetamines."  "In the UK in 1991, 42,209 people were convicted
of marijuana charges, clogging courts and overcrowding
prisons...and almost 90 per cent of drug offenses involve 
cannabis...The British government spends 500 million pounds a
year on "overall responses to drugs" but receives no tax revenue
from the estimated 1.8 billion pound illicit drug market" 
(Guardian).  Figures like this can be seen in the United States as
well.  The US spends billions of dollars annually on the war on
drugs.  If the government were to legalize marijuana, it could
reasonably place high taxes on it because people are used to
buying marijuana at extremely high prices created by the risks of
selling marijuana illegally.  It could be sold at a convenient store
just like a pack of cigarettes for less than someone would pay
now, but still yield a high profit because of easy growing
requirements.
	An entire industry could be created out of hemp based
products.  The oils extracted from seeds could be used for fuels
and the hemp fiber, a fiber so valued for its strength that it is
used to judge the quality of other fibers, could be manufactured
into ropes, clothing, or paper.  Most importantly, the money the
government would make from taxes and the money which would
be saved by not trying to prevent its use could be used for more
important things, such as serious drugs or the national debt.
	The recreational use of marijuana would not stimulate crime
like some would argue.  The crime rate in Amsterdam, where
marijuana is legal, is lower than many major US cities.  Mario
Lap, a key drug policy advisor in the Netherlands national
government says "We've had a realistic drug policy for 30 years in
the Netherlands, and we know what works.  We distinguish
between soft and hard drugs, between traffickers and users.  We
try not to make people into criminals"  (Houston Chronicle).      
	We can expect strong opposition from companies like
DuPont and paper manufacturers but the selfishness of these
corporations should not prevent its use in our society like it did
in the 1930's.  Regardless of what these organizations will say
about marijuana, the fact is it has the potential to become one of
the most useful substances in the entire world.  If we took action
and our government legalized it today, we would immediately see
benefits from this decision.  People suffering from illnesses
ranging from manic depression to Multiple Sclerosis would be 
able to experience relief.  The government could make billions of
dollars off of the taxes it could impose on its sale, and its
implementation into the industrial world would create thousands
of new jobs for the economy.  Also, because of its role in paper
making, the rain forests of South America could be saved from
their current fate of extinction.  No recorded deaths have ever
occurred as a result of marijuana use, it is not physically addictive
like alcohol or tobacco, and most doctors will agree it is safer to
use.  Marijuana being illegal has no validity at all.  Due to all the
positive aspects of marijuana it should be legalized in the United
States.
One of the most common illegal drug in the United States is marijuana.
There are mixed views about this drug, some people want it legalized,
other people don't.  In this essay, I hope to display the facts about
this illegal narcotic, and explain many vie Marijuana has many different 
names such as "kif" in Morocco, "doggo" in South Africa and "gangi" in India.
There are many slang terms for this type of drug such as "grass," "pot," 
"weed," "reefer,"  "mj,"  "boo," "broccoli," "ace'', "joint," "Colombian" 
Tetrahydrocnnabinal(THC)  was not found until the mid 1960's. Marijuana can be 
used medically or for an intoxicant. Doctors prescribe it to relieve pain for people 
in chemotherapy, or with other diseases.During the 1960's and 1970's  mainly teenagers 
used marijuana. In the 1970's 11% said they used it daily, but recently, only about 5% 
use it daily. In 1975, 27% of people said they used it that previous month, and in 1978,
 that figure grew to 39%, but dr Rapid, loud talking and bursts of laughter are in the

 can be acute.  The emotional development of adolescent users may be interrupted. Scientists feel 
heavy doses during adolescent damages emotional and intellectual development a

Should Marijuana be Legalized for Medical Purposes? 
Marijuana has been used extensively as a medical remedy for more than five thousand years.  In the early 1900s, medical 
usage of marijuana began to decline with the advent of alternative drugs. Injectable opiates and synthetic drugs such as 
aspirin and barbiturates began to replace marijuana as the physician's drug of choice in the twentieth-century, as their 
results proved to be more consistent than the sometimes erratic effects of the hard-to-dose potencies of marijuana (Grinspoon). 
 The Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 made cannabis so expensive to obtain that its usage as a medical remedy in the U.S. came to a 
halt.  Although now illegal in the U.S., marijuana continues to be used for both medical and recreational purposes by many
 Americans.  There are a variety of opinions both for and against the re-legalization of marijuana today. Perhaps the most
 controversial aspect of the legalization debate is whether marijuana should be legalized for medical purposes.
All drugs, both prescription and non-prescription, are federally 'Scheduled' by the DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency). 
A drug's scheduling under Federal law is determined "according to [its] effects, medical uses, and potential for abuse" 
(Claim V).  In this classification system, marijuana is a Schedule I drug, grouped with heroin, LSD, hashish, methaqualone,
 and designer drugs. These are drugs having "unpredictable effects, and [causing] severe psychological or physical dependence, or death" (Claim V).   
A closer analysis of the DEA's Federal Scheduling system reveals that, according to various studies by physicians on both 
sides of the legalization debate, marijuana does not  meet the requirements of a Schedule I drug, but not those of Schedule II.
The difference between the two classes is that Schedule I drugs may lead to death, while those on Schedule II are less 
likely to do so.  Proponents of legalization cite information that indicates marijuana is a relatively "safe" drug. 
"There is no known case of overdose; on the basis of animal models, the ratio of lethal to effective dose is 40,000
 to 1" (Grinspoon).  Even some opponents of marijuana legalization support reclassification. Two physicians, in a 
widely distributed opinions piece entitled "Marijuana Smoking as Medicine: A Cruel Hoax", wrote;  "While the
 reclassification of THC to Schedule II might be understandable, this would not be the result of smoking the 
crude drug marijuana, which would as a result become more available and more readily diverted for non-medical 
use"  (Nahas).  Although this evidence clearly does not support the legalization of marijuana, it highlights 
one of many discrepancies that cloud this smoky debate.Lester Grinspoon, MD, is a proponent of the medical 
legalization and re-classification of marijuana. In the Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. Grinspoon 
wrote an article entitled "A Plea for Reconsideration".  In this plea, Grinspoon suggests that marijuana should be 
reclassified to a Schedule II class drug, so that it might be legally prescribed.  He writes:
In a 1990 survey, 44% of oncologists said they had suggested  that a patient smoke marihuana for relief of the nausea 
induced by chemotherapy. If marihuana were actually unsafe for use under medical supervision, as its Schedule 
I status  explicitly affirms, this recommendation would be unthinkable.It is time for physicians to acknowledge 
more openly that this present classification is scientifically, legally, and morally wrong. (Grinspoon)
Like many other physicians fighting for the re-classification of marijuana, Dr. Grinspoon makes claims only 
towards the drug's medical benefits.  However, their rhetoric in calling the issue "morally wrong" suggests
 that they may have other motives as well.  
Furthermore, the fact that "44% of oncologists" suggested their patients use marijuana, despite 
its illegality, may suggest that many of these physicians have little respect for post-prohibition
 laws. The article also fails to address the negative side-effects of marijuana that result from smoking the plant. 
While there are many physicians who support the  reclassification (and, sometimes, legalization) of 
marijuana, still others make different claims. In July of 1995, one month after "Marijuana as Medicine- A 
Plea for Reconsideration" was published in JAMA,  the Department of Health and Human Services held its first 
research conference on marijuana.  At this conference, several respected physicians noted that "marijuana use
 during pregnancy has harmful effects on children's intellectual abilities... compulsive marijuana use may lead
 to an addiction similar to that of other illicit drugs..." (Claim V); and, finally, that "marijuana use can put
 a serious choke-hold on users who try to quit" (Claim V). Conflicting reports, such as these, are at the center
 of the smoke filled battle concerning medical legalization.  In this case, the physicians assembled at the 
conference commented only on the drug's negative effects, and they failed to discuss any possible beneficial effects.   
Although there are physicians both for and against the medical legalization of marijuana, the DEA enforces 
the laws.  The DEA regularly makes publications against legalization.  Claim V of these publications is 
entitled "There are no Compelling Reasons to Prescribe Marijuana or Heroin to Sick people".  In this claim,
 the DEA makes contradictory claims to those published in JAMA by Dr. Grinspoon. The DEA claims that "Not
 one American health association accepts marijuana as medicine.  Statements issued by these organizations
 express concern over the harmful effects of the drugs and over the lack of solid research demonstrating 
that they might do more good than harm" (Claim V).  However, in reading the DEA's clam, one must keep in
 mind that "drugs" (as they use it) includes both marijuana and heroin, and therefore may be partially 
invalid when applied to the central marijuana debate. By using the word "they", the DEA groups marijuana 
with more dangerous drugs.  It should also be recognized that the DEA has an obvious bias against legalizing
 drugs; if all drugs were legal, who would continue to pay their salaries? 
Doctors and the DEA, however, are not the only ones with opinions about marijuana's medical 
re-legalization.  Mike Dooley, a member of the National Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws 
(NORML), made  news when he recommended that Elvy Musikka, a patient legally supplied with 
marijuana from the U.S. government, spoke to an "Experimental Living" class at Western Michigan 
University:  "Elvy Musikkia, a professional speaker, has glaucoma and take marijuana as part of her
 treatment for the eye disease.  Glaucoma patients smoke marijuana cigarettes because it relieves the
 eye pressure that leads to blindness" (Kemp). However, Dooley supports more than the medical 
legalization of marijuana.  "Dooley says using marijuana for medical purposes is just one use of the 
plant, but people need to recognize that it has more positive uses" (Kemp). Like many other advocates
of legalization, Dooley wants more than just medical legalization:  "'Why are we outlawing this particular 
plant?' Dooley said. 'What is wrong with adults smoking marijuana in their own environment?'" (Kemp). 
Opponents of legalization efforts worry that legalization for medical purposes will eventually lead to
 non-medical abuse.An example of this type of medical abuse can be found in the 1995 Comedy, Friday.  
In the film, a corrupted priest tries to obtain marijuana from Smokey, a neighborhood pot addict. 
 Upon noticing the marijuana, he says "Excuse me brother, what we call drugs at 74th street Baptist 
Church, we call a sin" (Friday), representing the views of many Christians today.  Only a short time
 later, however, he changes his mind, saying: "Why don't you give me a little bit for my cataracts?" 
(Friday).   This film makes a comment on the attitudes of U.S. society today towards marijuana, and 
re-legalization.   By making a medical excuse for using marijuana in the film, Brother William  conveys
 the worries of many Americans today about medical legalization of the drug.  While it may be suggested
 that Friday is satirist comedy, and therefore not "real", critics of the film and of legalization will
 point out that later in the movie, the characters make an outright plea for legalization.
Religious figures in real life express stronger anti-legalization opinions than those in the movies.  
In 1986, "representatives of four Oregon church groups, representing a combined membership of tens of 
thousands, unveiled a plan to attack the proposed legalization of marijuana from the pulpit" (Danks).  
The representatives cited experiences like those Reverend John Jackson; Jackson spoke about how his son's
 drug habit broke up the family.  "'It got to the point that I kept a weapon,' Jackson said. 'My son didn't 
act like my son.  I got to the point where I thought if he came into the room I would kill him" (Danks).  
Many would be quick t discount the reverend's opinion, however, especially after hearing of his fatal 
mentality. It should also be noted that Jackson's son, who is now in the army, "graduated to harder drugs
 after using marijuana as a 10-year-old" (Danks). Other religious groups have more extreme views on legalization. 
  In an on-line publication entitled "Marijuana and Christians: Cure or Curse?", a group for 
"Aggressive Christianity" writes that: "Through the innocently appearing guise of the 'natural
 herbal high' called marijuana, Satan has found an open doorway for invasion into the minds of millions of people"
 (Marijuana and Christians).  These "Aggressive Christians" decree that marijuana is one of Satan's tools and should
 not be legalized for any purpose.  However, in calling it "Satan's tool" they incorporate little knowledge of the
 drug's true effects, both positive and negative.  For these extremists, there is apparently no reason for Satanists
 not to use marijuana.  Groups such as these "Aggressive Christians" represent the most conservative side of the battle
 over legalization. College campuses are often recognized for their liberal views and high drug consumption levels. 
 Adam Djurdjulov, a journalism senior and Arizona Daily Wildcat opinions editor writes a column that appears in that 
publication on Mondays.  In his column, titled "Airing it Out," he recently wrote an article, 
"Smoking marijuana is as accepted as the word 'damn.'"  In this column, Djurdjulov criticizes the
 increasing acceptance of marijuana use.  He states his un-professional medical opinion on marijuana,
 saying it "[is] a substance that destroys motivation and wazzu brain cells" (Djurdjulov).  Although he makes
 a valid argument that  drug use proliferates on today's college campuses, Djurdjulov weakens his own credibility
 when he suggests that Americans 'kick out' Bill Clinton from President of the United States for exercising his right to
 free speech, writing "Hell, on MTV in June 1992, Clinton quipped that if he tried marijuana again, he would inhale" 
(Djurdjulov). Although many  Americans might disagree with Clinton's "liberal" policies towards drug use,  few would 
condone his  removal from office, solely  for exercising his first amendment rights.  Like the "Aggressive Christians,
" Djurdjulov's non-scientific, extremist position somewhat destroys his credibility, along with the credibility of his
 statements.  Other college students feel differently about legalization.
Oliver Petri, a freshman at the University of Arizona, is a proponent of marijuana legalization for medical and 
recreational purposes.  In an interview, Petri explains that "I once knew a woman with cancer.  She grew [marijuana] 
plants in her backyard and smoked weed to relive her suffering.  It should totally be legal" (Petri).
Petri's comments epitomize the views of many college students who advocate legalization.  Few of these students, however,
 have any knowledge of the medical uses and properties of the drug they consume  for recreational purposes.  
Petri also admittedly supports medical legalization initiatives because he thinks it will make marijuana easier to find.
California's proposition 215 is an initiative that would legalize marijuana for medical purposes.  
 "[Proposition 215] would permit patients with cancer, AIDS, glaucoma, arthritis, and other serious
illnesses to grow, posses and use marijuana" (Lacayo). Despite criticism  of Prop 215 that suggests 
the initiative is "too loosely constructed", polls show that California voters favor it by almost 2-1 
(Lacayo).  Opponents of the initiative worry that anyone will be able to legally obtain and use 
under Proposition 215,  "'This proposition is not about medicine,' charges Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates,
 co-chairman of Citizens for a Drug Free California, the campaign opposing Prop 215.  'It's about the legalization
 of marijuana'" (Lacayo).  Voters like Sheriff Gates are unable to consider medical legalization because of their fears 
of increased recreational use. There opinion, then, means nothing when applied to the issue on a smaller scale.     
Reputable sources on marijuana's true effects are hard to come by.  Conflicting reports suggest that personal opinion 
might be more of a factor than it should be in many reports about the drug's effects and toxicity.  Words such as "dangerous"
 and "harmful" are often used by  figures on both sides of the legalization debate, with little explanation of their definitions
.  No-one knows what the results of a non-biased study on marijuana's medical future might contain, because conflicting
 "non-biased" studies continue to proliferate on both sides of this debate.  Because of the wide availability of 
marijuana today,  it is not surprising that marijuana usage for many today is a personal, rather than legal, decision.
In 1936 when Marijuana was made illegal it was considered a medicine in good standing with the American Medical Association. 
At the time Marijuana could be found in twenty eight different medical products and countless other consumer products. 
On November 5th, 1996 California and Arizona passed propositions allowing the return of medicinal Marijuana use.
The campaign in 1936 to make Marijuana an illegal substance was championed by two large companies, Dupont Chemicals and 
Hearst Newspapers, that gained financially by having Marijuana banned.  For Hearst Newspapers it was to protect the investment
 that they had just made buying a large amount of paper trees.   Marijuana can produce about 4 times the amount of paper 
 per acre than trees, and twice as many fibers per acre than cotton. (Hempnet 1)  Hearst was well aware of this and moved 
to ban Marijuana. Marijuana costs little to grow and can be made into cloth, canvas, and other high quality textiles
.  The use of Marijuana for
textile production would have seriously
 hurt Dupont who had invested heavily in 
both paper production and the use of cotton.  In 1936 Dupont joined Hearst and 
Leese 2
using scare tactics and effective lobbying were able to ban the growth, sale, and use of Marijuana.
Besides denying the public of the use of Marijuana as a textile, food source, and alternative energy source, 
these large companies selfishly robbed many sick people of a drug that can help them.  Marijuana can be used to combat glaucoma,
 epilepsy, Multiple Sclerosis, back pain, asthma, rheumatism, arthritis, migraines, emphysema, cystic fibrosis, and promotes 
appetite in some cancer and AIDS patients. Drugs like morphine, valium, lithium, and codeine are regularly given to patients and 
are far more addictive, having many more negative affects than Marijuana.  Marijuana "has little effect on major physiological 
functions.  There is no known case of a lethal overdose; on the basis of animal models, the ratio of lethal to effective dose is 
estimated at 40,000 to 1." (Bakalar and Grinspoon 1875)   "Marijuana, like aspirin, a substance known to be unusually safe and to 
have enormous potential health benefits. ... In fact in a 1990 survey, 44% of oncologist said they had suggested that a patient 
smoke marijuana for relief of nausea induced by chemotherapy." (Bakalar and Grinspoon 1875) And many times it only takes one or 
two puffs off a joint to calm the patient and relieve their nausea and help increase 
their appetite. (Silverberg 1)  Californian and Arizona voters finally acknowledge 
the benefits of Marijuana and acted to change the situation.
The Federal Drug Enforcement Administration maintains there is no 
Leese 3
medical evidence that smoking marijuana has ever helped anyone, but it is difficult to dismiss the testimony from many seriously 
ill patients and their doctors that marijuana can ease pain, reduce the nausea associated with cancer chemotherapy, stimulate the
 appetites of AIDS patients who are wasting away, and lower the pressure within the eyes of glaucoma victims. " The traditional 
use of Cannabis as an analgesic, anti-asthmatic, and anti-rheumatic drug is well established. A British study also suggests that
 cultivation of Cannabis plants rich in Cannabidiol (CBD) and other phenolic substances would be useful not only as fiber producing
 plants but also for medicinal purposes in the treatment of certain inflammatory disorders. CBD was found to be more effective than
 aspirin as an anti-inflammatory agent."  (Evans 361-371)  The Food and Drug Administration has approved a synthetic version of THC,
 a main ingredient of marijuana, that can help in such cases, but many patients complain that it is a poor substitute and is much
 more expensive. The alternative choices to smoking marijuana, and there are a couple, but mainly  pills are what's   on the
 market;  they are suppose to have the same therapeutic effects that so many 
suffering patients say they feel when they smoke marijuana. The leading capsule  on the market is Dronabinol; it's  main 
agent is Cannabidiol. "In a Brazilian study of 8 
Epileptic patients receiving Cannabidiol, (CBD), 4 were free of convulsions, 3 had partial improvement, and 1 was unchanged." 
(Cunha 176) The only problem
Leese 4
with the pill is that it has to be digested, and for some one who is suffering from nausea it is virtually impossible to 
keep the capsule down. "Because it's a pill, and therefore slower acting, people have trouble adjusting the dosage; they often 
find themselves taking too much. It also seems to cause high levels of anxiety and depression" (Brookhiser 27) Unfortunately no
 method other then smoking has seemed to help so many with the least complications.  What is needed now is a more thorough effort
 to test the claims from reputable sources that marijuana may be a compassionate means of relieving suffering.  Many believe that 
drug enforcement authorities have instead cut back on research out of fear that it would become impossible to limit marijuana use 
to those who need it medically. The fears are understandable, especially given the rising use of marijuana among teenagers today. 
 But it ought to be possible to regulate marijuana as a prescription drug if it is found to be of legitimate benefit for sick people.
State initiatives are a clumsy way to set policy. The California proposition, for example, is so vaguely written that it could lead 
to wholesale distribution of
marijuana well beyond the medical scope intended by those who voted for it. It says nothing about withholding marijuana from young 
people or from those operating  
dangerous equipment.  It also suggests that a simple oral recommendation from any doctor would suffice. That loose provision, designed
 to get around Federal laws that bar doctors from prescribing an illegal substance, makes abuse of the new law 
Leese 5
inevitable. The Arizona law, by contrast, requires that marijuana be prescribed in writing by two doctors. But that measure is also
 written too broadly. It says that many other drugs, not simply marijuana, may be prescribed if permission from two doctors is obtained. 
 Supporters of the California measure did their cause no good by immediately lighting up marijuana joints after it passed this last year 
and proclaiming that a legitimate medicinal use would include smoking a joint to relieve stress. Dennis Peron, originator of the California
 initiative, said afterward he believes all marijuana use is medical -- except for kids. These actions made it obvious that the goal of at 
least some supporters is to get marijuana legalized outright, a proposition that opinion polls indicate most Americans reject. 
Parents have legitimate concerns about the increase in marijuana use among teenagers. Many who used marijuana a generation ago are struggling 
over what to tell their children, but they need to realize that today's marijuana is more potent than the version they smoked thanks 
to the invention of hydroponics; a self-monitoring 
greenhouse setup intentionally to help cultivate marijuana. It waters itself, adjust the temperature, and optimize the conditions
 causing THC levels to drastically increase,
and even cause crystallization of the plant because of its high potency.  Testing has shown the drug to be far more dangerous to
 young people than was known in the 1960's and 1970's.  It can be particularly harmful to the growth and development of teenagers.
  California's Attorney General, Daniel Lungren, has ordered state law 
Leese 6
enforcement officials to interpret the law's language narrowly and require proof from those arrested that marijuana is being used medically.  
The Clinton Administration  announced an aggressive campaign to combat the state propositions, including criminal prosecution 
of doctors who prescribe marijuana. That hard line makes sense for now; if the Government refuses to investigate carefully 
the claims about medical use of marijuana, it will only spur voters in other states to take the issue into their own hands.
 It is a shame that a plant that can do so much good, has to be blacklisted because of misrepresentation, and the ignorance
 by the general public of just how many uses and advantages marijuana can bring man. From its industrial hemp, to its 
medicinal relief this plant has barely scratched the surface and has hardly been used to its full potential. As long as
 the U.S has narrow-minded politicians marijuana will never have a real shot to prove whether it can be a wonder
 drug/textile that many informed, rational persons envision it to be.Medical Marijuana Initiative Section 1. Section 11362.5 
is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:  11362.5. (a) This section shall be known and may be cited as the Compassionat
e Use Act of 1996.  (b) (l) The people of the State of California hereby find
and declare that the purposes of the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 are as follows: (A) To ensure that seriously ill Californians
 have the right to obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes where that medical use is deemed appropriate and has been 
recommended by a physician who has determined that the person's health would benefit from the use of marijuana in the treatment
 of cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or any other illness for which marijuana 
provides relief. (B) To ensure that patients and their primary caregivers who obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes upon
 the recommendation of a physician are not subject to criminal prosecution or sanction.  (C) To encourage the federal and state 
governments to
implement a plan to provide for the safe and affordable distribution of marijuana to all patients in medical need of marijuana.  
(2) Nothing in this act shall be construed to supersede  legislation prohibiting persons from engaging in conduct
that endangers others, nor to condone the diversion of marijuana for nonmedical purposes. With standing any other provision of
 law, no physician in this state shall be punished, or denied any right or privilege, for having recommended marijuana to a 
patient for medical purposes.  (d) Section 11357, relating to the possession of marijuana, and Section 11358, relating to the
 cultivation of marijuana, shall not apply to a patient, or to a patient's primary caregiver, who possesses or cultivates 
marijuana for the personal medical purposes of the patient upon the written or oral recommendation or approval of a physician. 
 (e) For the purposes of this section, "primary caregiver" means the individual designated by the person exempted under this 
act who has consistently assumed responsibility for  the housing, health, or safety of that person. Sec. 2. If any provision 
of this measure or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect
 other provisions or applications of the measure which can be given effect without the  invalid provision or application, and
 to this en d the provisions of this measure are severable. 
On November 5th, Californians approved Prop. 215, allowing patients to use medical marijuana.  Voter support of this historic 
new law was 55.7% in favor verses only 44.3% opposed, a spread of 11.4 points. 
The passage of Proposition 215 would give the people of California legal access to a remarkably safe, highly versatile, 
and potentially inexpensive medicine. Patients find marijuana helpful for nausea and vomiting, for glaucoma and as an appetite 
stimulant. It is used for the relief of muscle spasms and seizures, as well as osteoarthritis, menstrual cramps, migraine and 
other forms of chronic pain. It is safer than most prescription
medicines and often works better, with less serious side effects. 
If marijuana were not prohibited, it would also be less expensive than most conventional medications. The cost of medical 
marijuana would be $20 to $30 an ounce, or about 30 cents per cigarette. Once cigarette usually relieves the nausea and vomiting 
produced by cancer chemotherapy. So does a standard dose of Zofran, the best legally available treatment, which costs $30 
to $40 - at least 100 times the price of marijuana. According to a 1995 poll conducted by the American Civil Liberties
 Union, 85 percent of Americans think marijuana should be available as a medicine. Interest in medical  marijuana is 
becoming so great that physicians in California and elsewhere may soon be asked to assume responsibilities for which 
they are unprepared. Nineteenth-century doctors were more sophisticated about marijuana than contemporary ones. Between 
1840 and 1900, more than 100 articles on the therapeutic use of the drug then known as Indian hemp were published in
 European and American medical journals. When medical use in the United States was effectively outlawed by the Marijuana 
Tax Act of 1937, the American Medical Association, to its credit, opposed the ban. Since then, unfortunately, the medical
 community has become largely ignorant about marijuana and has been a victim and an agent in the spread of misinformation. 
This situation is finally beginning to change. Doctors are learning about marijuana in an unusual way not from articles in
 medical journals or from drug company advertisements, but from their patients. There have been many cases observed that 
many patients who use marijuana to relieve symptoms from muscle spasms to severe depression. Their doctors respond in 
different ways.  A few condemn marijuana use, and some pretend to ignore it or profess indifference, but most offer some 
encouragement or moral support despite the fact that marijuana is classified under federal law as "unsafe for use under 
medical supervision."
Obviously doctors confronted with medical need can recognize the foolishness of this law. But most are either afraid to
 do anything more or unable to provide further help because they know to little. Physicians will find that more and 
more patients are approaching them with questions about marijuana. They will have to learn which
symptoms and disorders may be better treated with marijuana than with conventional medications. They will also need to 
instruct patients who are unfamiliar with marijuana in the best ways to use it. To accomplish that, they must listen 
more carefully to their patients and educated themselves and one another about this medicine.
Physicians have long recognized the need for continuing medical education (CME) to keep themselves up to date on new 
drugs and techniques. As Proposition 215 comes to California, physicians should do their part in fulfilling its promise
 by organizing CME courses on the medical use of marijuana.

	The debate over the legalization of Cannabis sativa, more
commonly known as marijuana, has been one of the most heated
controversies ever to occur in the United States.  Its use as a
medicine has existed for thousands of years in many countries
world wide and is documented as far back as 2700 BC in ancient
Chinese writings.  When someone says ganja, cannabis, bung,
dope, grass, rasta, or weed, they are  talking about the same
subject:  marijuana.  Marijuana should be legalized because the
government could earn money from taxes on its sale, its value to
the medical world outweighs its abuse potential, and because of
its importance to the paper and clothing industries.  This action
should be taken despite efforts made by groups which say
marijuana is a harmful drug which will increase crime rates and
lead users to other more dangerous substances.
	The actual story behind the legislature passed against
marijuana is quite surprising.  According to Jack Herer, author of
The Emperor  Wears No Clothes, the acts bringing about the
demise of hemp were part of a large conspiracy involving DuPont,
Harry J. Anslinger, commissioner of the Federal Bureau of
Narcotics (FBN), and many other influential industrial leaders
such as William Randolph Hearst and Andrew Mellon.  Herer
notes that the Marijuana Tax Act, which passed in 1937,
coincidentally occurred just as the decoricator machine was
invented.  With this invention, hemp would have been able to
take over competing industries almost instantaneously. 
According to Popular Mechanics, "10,000 acres devoted to hemp
will produce as much paper as 40,000 acres of average [forest]
pulp land." William Hearst owned enormous timber acreage so his
interest in preventing the growth of hemp can be easily explained. 
Competition from hemp would have easily driven the Hearst
paper-manufacturing company out of business and significantly
lowered the value of his land.  Herer even suggests popularizing
the term "marijuana" was a strategy Hearst used in order to create
fear in the American public.  Herer says "The first step in creating
hysteria was to introduce the element of fear of the unknown by
using a word that no one had ever heard of before... 'marijuana'".
	DuPont's involvement in the anti-hemp campaign can also
be explained with great ease.  At this time, DuPont was patenting
a new sulfuric acid process for producing wood-pulp paper. 
According to the company's own records, wood-pulp products
ultimately accounted for more than 80% of all DuPont's railroad
car loadings for the 50 years the Marijuana Tax Act was passed.  It
should also be said that two years before the prohibitive hemp tax
in 1937, DuPont developed nylon which was a substitute for hemp
rope.  The year after the tax was passed DuPont came out with
rayon, which would have been unable to compete with the
strength of hemp fiber or its  economical process of
manufacturing.  "DuPont's point man was none other than Harry
Anslinger...who was appointed to the FBN by Treasury Secretary
Andrew  Mellon, who was also chairman of the Mellon Bank,
DuPont's chief financial backer.  Anslinger's relationship to
Mellon wasn't just political, he was also married to Mellon's niece" 
(Hartsell).  
	The reasoning behind DuPont, Anslinger, and Hearst was
not for any moral or health related issues.  They fought to prevent
the growth of this new industry so they wouldn't lose money.  In
fact, the American Medical Association tried to argue for the
medical benefits of hemp.  Marijuana is actually less dangerous
than alcohol, cigarettes, and even most over-the-counter
medicines or prescriptions.  According to Francis J. Young, the
DEA's administrative judge, "nearly all medicines have toxic,
potentially lethal affects, but marijuana is not such a
substance...Marijuana, in its natural form, is one of the safest
therapeutically active substances known to man.  By any measure
of rational analysis marijuana can be safely used within a
supervised routine of medical care"  (DEA Docket No. 86-22, 57). 
It doesn't make sense then, for marijuana to be illegal in the
United States  when alcohol poisoning is a major cause of death
in this country and approximately 400,000 premature deaths are
attributed to cigarettes annually.  Dr. Roger Pertwee, Secretary of
the International Cannabis Research Society states that as a
recreational drug, "Marijuana compares favorably to nicotine,
alcohol, and even caffeine."  Under extreme amounts of alcohol a
person will experience an "inability to stand or walk without help,
stupor and near unconsciousness, lack of comprehension of what
is seen or heard, shock, and breathing and heartbeat may stop." 
Even though these effects occur only under an extreme amount of
alcohol consumption, (.2-.5 BAL) the fact is smoking extreme
amounts of marijuana will do nothing more than put you to sleep,
while drinking excessive amounts of alcohol will kill you.
	The most profound activist for marijuana's use as a
medicine is Dr. Lester Grinspoon, author of Marihuana:  The
Forbidden Medicine. According to Grinspoon, "The only well
confirmed negative effect of marijuana is caused by the smoke,
which contains three times more tars and five times more carbon
monoxide than tobacco.  But even the heaviest marijuana smokers
rarely use as much as an average tobacco smoker.  And, of course,
many prefer to eat it."  His book includes personal accounts of
how prescribed marijuana alleviated epilepsy, weight loss of AIDs,
nausea of chemotherapy, menstrual pains, and the severe effects
of Multiple Sclerosis.  The illness with the most documentation
and harmony among doctors which marijuana has successfully
treated is MS.  Grinspoon believes for MS sufferers, "Cannabis is
the drug of necessity."  One patient of his, 51 year old Elizabeth
MacRory, says "It has completely changed my life...It has helped
with muscle spasms, allowed me to sleep properly, and helped
control my bladder."  Marijuana also proved to be effective in the
treatment of glaucoma because its use lowers pressure on the eye. 
	"In a recent survey at a leading teaching hospital, 'over 60
per cent of medical students were found to be marijuana users.' 
In the same survey, only 30 per cent admitted to smoking
cigarettes"  (Guardian).  Brian Hilliard, editor of Police Review,
says "Legalizing cannabis wouldn't do any harm to anybody.  We
should be concentrating on the serious business of heroin and
amphetamines."  "In the UK in 1991, 42,209 people were convicted
of marijuana charges, clogging courts and overcrowding
prisons...and almost 90 per cent of drug offenses involve 
cannabis...The British government spends 500 million pounds a
year on "overall responses to drugs" but receives no tax revenue
from the estimated 1.8 billion pound illicit drug market" 
(Guardian).  Figures like this can be seen in the United States as
well.  The US spends billions of dollars annually on the war on
drugs.  If the government were to legalize marijuana, it could
reasonably place high taxes on it because people are used to
buying marijuana at extremely high prices created by the risks of
selling marijuana illegally.  It could be sold at a convenient store
just like a pack of cigarettes for less than someone would pay
now, but still yield a high profit because of easy growing
requirements.
	An entire industry could be created out of hemp based
products.  The oils extracted from seeds could be used for fuels
and the hemp fiber, a fiber so valued for its strength that it is
used to judge the quality of other fibers, could be manufactured
into ropes, clothing, or paper.  Most importantly, the money the
government would make from taxes and the money which would
be saved by not trying to prevent its use could be used for more
important things, such as serious drugs or the national debt.
	The recreational use of marijuana would not stimulate crime
like some would argue.  The crime rate in Amsterdam, where
marijuana is legal, is lower than many major US cities.  Mario
Lap, a key drug policy advisor in the Netherlands national
government says "We've had a realistic drug policy for 30 years in
the Netherlands, and we know what works.  We distinguish
between soft and hard drugs, between traffickers and users.  We
try not to make people into criminals"  (Houston Chronicle).      
	We can expect strong opposition from companies like
DuPont and paper manufacturers but the selfishness of these
corporations should not prevent its use in our society like it did
in the 1930's.  Regardless of what these organizations will say
about marijuana, the fact is it has the potential to become one of
the most useful substances in the entire world.  If we took action
and our government legalized it today, we would immediately see
benefits from this decision.  People suffering from illnesses
ranging from manic depression to Multiple Sclerosis would be 
able to experience relief.  The government could make billions of
dollars off of the taxes it could impose on its sale, and its
implementation into the industrial world would create thousands
of new jobs for the economy.  Also, because of its role in paper
making, the rain forests of South America could be saved from
their current fate of extinction.  No recorded deaths have ever
occurred as a result of marijuana use, it is not physically addictive
like alcohol or tobacco, and most doctors will agree it is safer to
use.  Marijuana being illegal has no validity at all.  Due to all the
positive aspects of marijuana it should be legalized in the United
States.
