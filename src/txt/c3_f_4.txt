This in turn will help to protect employees from the possibility of harm.

For example, an employer has a responsibility to:-

* Carry out risk assessments on a regular basis, implementing measures to reduce risks and hazards;

* Consult employees regarding risk assessments and inform them health and safety policy;

* Provide training and information regarding health and safety, if appropriate;

* Provide the correct workplace facilities and equipment;

* Have first-aid arrangements in place;

* Display the health and safety poster where employees can easily read it.

* Inform the appropriate person (such as your employer or supervisor) if you have concerns regarding health and safety at work.

Accidents at Work - What Action Can You Take?

If this is done properly, the risk of an employee suffering an injury while at work will be significantly reduced. Unfortunately, however, not all places of work comply with health and safety law, meaning accidents do still occur on a regular basis.

But if you have been injured because an employer or colleague has failed to meet to their health and safety responsibilities, what exactly can you do? Many people will decide to make a formal complaint, or simply ensure that the incident has been recorded in the company's accident handbook. However, some may feel this does not recompense for the pain and suffering they have experienced. If so, you need to contact a personal injury lawyer today, as you may be able to take legal action.

Workplace injury and abuses nonetheless happen, nevertheless, particularly in the event you do not know your rights. If you have been injured at work simply because your employer has not provided appropriate safety measures or you have suffered a workplace injury and were subsequently laid off or not paid for your recovery time, get in touch with a lawyer immediately. Whenever a worker is injured on the job, consulting an injury lawyer is a good idea. Nevertheless, maintain in mind that there are several things that a person can do that can seriously damage their workers' compensation case prior to the lawyer even has a chance to offer his guidance. An employee has to know that even though the employer has a responsibility to keep the work atmosphere secure, so does the employee. Additionally, there are several issues an employee can do to trigger the claim to be questioned.

Not just does every of the 50 states have their own workers' compensation laws, but also the Well being and Safety at work Act has ensured that all employees will probably be offered a minimum amount of protection. This protection includes some level of tax-free wage compensation and coverage of medical bills. Whilst employers are charged with taking reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of their employees, maintain in mind that employees have a responsibility to take precautions as well.

Finally, medical treatment can either significantly assist or hurt a workers' compensation case. Make sure to be completely honest with the physician.

Could You Be Deported For Shoplifting?   by KSchaefer



Based upon your situation, a shoplifting conviction may bring about deportation. It is best to seek the advice of your immigration lawyer if you've been charged with shoplifting and well before you enter into a plea or go to trial.

When can you be deported for shoplifting?

Crimes of moral turpitude, also known as CMTs, can lead to deportation or removal proceedings. A theft offense, such as shoplifting, is generally considered to be a CMT. What crimes qualify as a CMT is a very complicated area of immigration law and you should have an immigration law firm take a look at your case to confirm if your charge falls within the definition of a CMT.

CMT convictions that happen within five years of your admittance to the United States can lead to deportation if the crime may lead to a sentence of one year or more in jail. This one year or more of confinement requirement refers to the possible sentence, not the actual sentence that you received. You should not simply depend upon the fact that you were not sentenced to 1 year or more in prison -- your immigration attorney will need to review the criminal code to ascertain the maximum possible sentence you could have received.

It is essential that you discuss your options with an immigration lawyer if you are placed in deportation or removal proceedings as a result of a shoplifting conviction. You may be able to get relief from removal which would keep you from being deported.

Some shoplifting convictions might even be considered to be aggravated felonies under immigration law. This issue is very important for you to discuss with your immigration law firm because if you are convicted of an immigration aggravated felony you may not have any type of relief from deportation or removal.

Can a shoplifting conviction make you become inadmissible to America?

Inadmissibility could be a consequence of being convicted of shoplifting or some other CMT. This is important because being found to inadmissible can destroy your dreams for the future such as getting a green card, getting a visa or being allowed to enter the United States. But, you should check with an immigration lawyer if this may be an issue for you to see if you qualify for an exception. For example, some people may qualify for an exception to being inadmissible if they were under 18 when the crime was committed or if they qualify for the petty offense exception. Where the maximum penalty for your crime was one year of confinement and you were not sentenced to more than six months of confinement, you could be eligible for the petty offense exception. Your immigration attorney will be able to advise you about these exceptions after reviewing your case, including all of the documents related to your conviction and the relevant criminal statute. 



Intro To California Work Comp   by David Park



"NO FAULT" - AT LEAST IN THEORY

In California, workers' compensation claims are administered through a "no-fault" insurance system. If you suffer an injury on the job, you file a worker's compensation claim against your employer, and your employer is required by law to provide you with workers' compensation benefits, including medical treatment, all without your having to prove whose fault it was.

There is a trade-off though. On one hand, the injured worker is supposed to receive quick and easy access to medical treatment and disability benefits. On the other hand, the employer is protected from any civil lawsuits over the injury with the exception of certain very limited circumstances.

THE REALITY OF WORK COMP

This trade-off is not always in the injured worker's favor, however. For example, workers' compensation benefits do not include compensation for things like lost earnings and pain and suffering, which are allowed normally in a regular civil lawsuit.

Even worse, when you're injured at work, the reality is that your employer's worker's compensation insurance company will do whatever it takes to minimize their cost and expense on your claim. That is just what they do.

DON'T BE ANYBODY'S FOOL

Don't be naive and think idealistically that just because you busted your butt, day in and day out, perhaps for many, many years, working for your company, that now that you've been hurt, the company is going to step up, do the right thing, and take care of you, their loyal employee. Wrong. In fact, nothing could be farther from the truth.

If you have been injured at work, report the injury to your employer by telling your supervisor right away. If your injury or illness developed over time, report it as soon as you learn or believe it was caused by your job.

Reporting your injury promptly helps prevent problems and delays in receiving benefits, including medical care you may need. If your employer does not learn about your injury within 30 days and this prevents your employer from fully investigating the injury and how you were injured, you could lose your right to receive workers' compensation benefits.

DISCLAIMER: Please keep in mind that this article is intended for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. You are expressly advised to seek legal counsel if you have questions about your particular workers' compensation claim.

WARNING: Any person who makes or causes to be made any knowingly false or fraudulent material statement or material representation for the purpose of obtaining or denying worker's compensation benefits or payments in California is guilty of a felony.
