stood shoulder to shoulder, facing the Gryffindors, leering to a man.

    "But I booked the field!" said Wood, positively spitting with rage. "I booked it!"

   "Ah," said Flint. "But I've got a specially signed note here from Professor Snape. `I, Professor S.
Snape, give the Slytherin team permission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the
need to train their new Seeker'. "

    "You've got a new Seeker?" said Wood, distracted. "Where?"

    And from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh, smaller boy, smirking all over his
pale, pointed face. It was Draco Malfoy.

    "Aren't you Lucius Malfoy's son?" said Fred, looking at Malfoy with dislike.

    "Funny you should mention Draco's father," said Flint as the whole Slytherin team smiled still more
broadly. "Let me show you the generous gift he's made to the Slytherin team."

     All seven of them held out their broomsticks. Seven highly polished, brand-new handles and seven
sets of fine gold lettering spelling the words Nimbus Two Thousand and One gleamed under the
Gryffindors' noses in the early morning sun.

    "Very latest model. Only came out last month," said Flint carelessly, flicking a speck of dust from the
end of his own. "I believe it outstrips the old Two Thousand series by a considerable amount. As for the
old Cleansweeps" -- he smiled nastily at Fred and George, who were both clutching Cleansweep Fives
--" sweeps the board with them."

    None of the Gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a moment. Malfoy was smirking so
broadly his cold eyes were reduced to slits.

    "Oh, look," said Flint. "A field invasion."

    Ron and Hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on.

    "What's happening?" Ron asked Harry. "Why aren't you playing? And what's he doing here?"

    He was looking at Malfoy, taking in his Slytherin Quidditch robes.

    "I'm the new Slytherin Seeker, Weasley," said Malfoy, smugly. "Everyone's just been admiring the
brooms my father's bought our team.

    Ron gaped, open-mouthed, at the seven superb broomsticks in front of him.

   "Good, aren't they?" said Malfoy smoothly. "But perhaps the Gryffindor team will be able to raise
some gold and get new brooms, too. You could raffle off those Cleansweep Fives; I expect a museum
would bid for them."

    The Slytherin team howled with laughter.

    "At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in," said Hermione sharply. " Theygot
in on pure talent."


                                                                                                              Page 64

    The smug look on Malfoy's face flickered.

    "No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood," he spat.

     Harry knew at once that Malfoy had said something really bad because there was an instant uproar
at his words. Flint had to dive in front of Malfoy to stop Fred and George jumping on him, Alicia
shrieked, "How dare you!" and Ron plunged his hand into his robes, pulled out his wand, yelling,
"You'll pay for that one, Malfoy!" and pointed it furiously under Flint's arm at Malfoys face.

   A loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot out of the wrong end of Ron's
wand, hitting him in the stomach and sending him reeling backward onto the grass.

    "Ron! Ron! Are you all right?" squealed Hermione.

    Ron opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. Instead he gave an almighty belch and
several slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap.

    The Slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter. Flint was doubled up, hanging onto his new
broomstick for support. Malfoy was on all fours, banging the ground with his fist. The Gryffindors were
gathered around Ron, who kept belching large, glistening slugs. Nobody seemed to want to touch him.

    "We'd better get him to Hagrid's, it's nearest," said Harry to Hermione, who nodded bravely, and
the pair of them pulled Ron up by the arms.

    "What happened, Harry? What happened? Is he ill? But you can cure him, can't you?" Colin had run
down from his seat and was now dancing alongside them as they left the field. Ron gave a huge heave
and more slugs dribbled down his front.

    "Oooh," said Colin, fascinated and raising his camera. "Can you hold him still, Harry?"

   "Get out of the way, Colin!" said Harry angrily. He and Hermione supported Ron out of the stadium
and across the grounds toward the edge of the forest.

   "Nearly there, Ron," said Hermione as the gamekeeper's cabin came into view. "You'll be all right in
a minute -- almost there --"

   They were within twenty feet of Hagrid's house when the front door opened, but it wasn't Hagrid
who emerged. Gilderoy Lockhart, wearing robes of palest mauve today, came striding out.

   "Quick, behind here," Harry hissed, dragging Ron behind a nearby bush. Hermione followed,
somewhat reluctantly.

    "It's a simple matter if you know what you're doing!" Lockhart was saying loudly to Hagrid. "If you
need help, you know where I am! I'll let you have a copy of my book. I'm surprised you haven't already
got one -- I'll sign one tonight and send it over. Well, good-bye!" And he strode away toward the
castle.

    Harry waited until Lockhart was out of sight, then pulled Ron out of the bush and up to Hagrid's
front door. They knocked urgently.




                                                                                                          Page 65

   Hagrid appeared at once, looking very grumpy, but his expression brightened when he saw who it
was.

    "Bin wonderin' when you'd come ter see me -- come in, come in -- thought you mighta bin
Professor Lockhart back again --"

    Harry and Hermione supported Ron over the threshold into the one-roomed cabin, which had an
enormous bed in one corner, a fire crackling merrily in the other. Hagrid didn't seem perturbed by Ron's
slug problem, which Harry hastily explained as he lowered Ron into a chair.

   "Better out than in," he said cheerfully, plunking a large copper basin in front of him. "Get `em all up,
Ron."

    "I don't think there's anything to do except wait for it to stop," said Hermione anxiously, watching
Ron bend over the basin. "That's a difficult curse to work at the best of times, but with a broken wand
--"

    Hagrid was bustling around making them tea. His boarhound, Fang, was slobbering over Harry.

    "What did Lockhart want with you, Hagrid?" Harry asked, scratching Fang's ears.

    "Givin' me advice on gettin' kelpies out of a well," growled Hagrid, moving a half-plucked rooster off
his scrubbed table and setting down the teapot. "Like I don' know. An' bangin' on about some banshee
he banished. If one word of it was true, I'll eat my kettle."

    It was most unlike Hagrid to criticize a Hogwarts' teacher, and Harry looked at him in surprise.
Hermione, however, said in a voice somewhat higher than usual, "I think you're being a bit unfair.
Professor Dumbledore obviously thought he was the best man for the job --"

     "He was the on'y man for the job," said Hagrid, offering them a plate of treacle fudge, while Ron
coughed squelchily into his basin. "An' I mean the on'y one. Gettin' very difficult ter find anyone fer the
Dark Arts job. People aren't too keen ter take it on, see. They're startin' ter think it's jinxed. No one's
lasted long fer a while now. So tell me," said Hagrid, jerking his head at Ron. "Who was he tryin' ter
curse?"

    "Malfoy called Hermione something -- it must've been really bad, because everyone went wild."

    "It was bad," said Ron hoarsely, emerging over the tabletop looking pale and sweaty. "Malfoy called
her `Mudblood,' Hagrid --"

    Ron dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made their appearance. Hagrid looked
outraged.

    "He didn'!" he growled at Hermione.

    "He did," she said. "But I don't know what it means. I could tell it was really rude, of course --"

    "It's about the most insulting thing he could think of," gasped Ron, coming back up. "Mudblood's a
really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born -- you know, non-magic parents. There are some
wizards -- like Malfoy's family -- who think they're better than everyone else because they're what
people call pure-blood." He gave a small burp, and a single slug fell into his outstretched hand. He threw


                                                                                                               Page 66

it into the basin and continued, "I mean, the rest of us know it doesn't make any difference at all. Look at
Neville Longbottom -- he's pure-blood and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way up."

    "An' they haven't invented a spell our Hermione can' do," said Hagrid proudly, making Hermione go
a brilliant shade of magenta.

   "It's a disgusting thing to call someone," said Ron, wiping his sweaty brow with a shaking hand.
"Dirty blood, see. Common blood. It's ridiculous. Most wizards these days are half-blood anyway. If we
hadn't married Muggles we'd've died out."

       He retched and ducked out of sight again.

    "Well, I don' blame yeh fer tryin' ter curse him, Ron," said Hagrid loudly over the thuds of more
slugs hitting the basin. "Bu' maybe it was a good thing yer wand backfired. 'Spect Lucius Malfoy
would've come marchin' up ter school if yeh'd cursed his son. Least yer not in trouble."

   Harry would have pointed out that trouble didn't come much worse than having slugs pouring out of
your mouth, but he couldn't; Hagrid's treacle fudge had cemented his jaws together.

    "Harry," said Hagrid abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought. "Gotta bone ter pick with yeh.
I've heard you've bin givin' out signed photos. How come I haven't got one?"

       Furious, Harry wrenched his teeth apart.

       "I have not been giving out signed photos," he said hotly. "If Lockhart's still spreading that around
--"

       But then he saw that Hagrid was laughing.

    "I'm on'y jokin'," he said, patting Harry genially on the back and sending him face first into the table.
"I knew yeh hadn't really. I told Lockhart yeh didn' need teh. Yer more famous than him without tryin'."

       "Bet he didn't like that," said Harry, sitting up and rubbing his chin.

   "Don' think he did," said Hagrid, his eyes twinkling. "An' then I told him I'd never read one o' his
books an' he decided ter go. Treacle fudge, Ron?" he added as Ron reappeared.

       "No thanks," said Ron weakly. "Better not risk it."

       "Come an' see what I've bin growin'," said Hagrid as Harry and Hermione finished the last of their
tea.

    In the small vegetable patch behind Hagrid's house were a dozen of the largest pumpkins Harry had
ever seen. Each was the size of a large boulder.

    "Gettin' on well, aren't they?" said Hagrid happily. "Fer the Halloween feast...should be big enough
by then."

       "What've you been feeding them?" said Harry.

       Hagrid looked over his shoulder to check that they were alone.


                                                                                                                Page 67

    "Well, I've bin givin' them -- you know -- a bit o' help --"

    Harry noticed Hagrid's flowery pink umbrella leaning against the back wall of the cabin. Harry had
had reason to believe before now that this umbrella was not all it looked; in fact, he had the strong
impression that Hagrid's old school wand was concealed inside it. Hagrid wasn't supposed to use magic.
He had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, but Harry had never found out why -- any
mention of the matter and Hagrid would clear his throat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the
subject was changed.

  "An Engorgement Charm, I suppose?" said Hermione, halfway between disapproval and amusement.
"Well, you've done a good job on them."

    "That's what yer little sister said," said Hagrid, nodding at Ron. "Met her jus' yesterday." Hagrid
looked sideways at Harry, his beard twitching. "Said she was jus' lookin' round the grounds, but I
reckon she was hopin' she might run inter someone else at my house." He winked at Harry. "If yeh ask
me, she wouldn' say no ter a signed --"

    "Oh, shut up," said Harry. Ron snorted with laughter and the ground was sprayed with slugs.

    "Watch it!" Hagrid roared, pulling Ron away from his precious pumpkins.

    It was nearly lunchtime and as Harry had only had one bit of treacle fudge since dawn, he was keen
to go back to school to eat. They said good-bye to Hagrid and walked back up to the castle, Ron
hiccoughing occasionally, but only bringing up two very small slugs.

    They had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall when a voice rang out, "There you are, Potter --
Weasley." Professor McGonagall was walking toward them, looking stern. "You will both do your
detentions this evening."

    "What're we doing, Professor?" said Ron, nervously suppressing a burp.

   " Youwill be polishing the silver in the trophy room with Mr. Filch," said Professor McGonagall.
"And no magic, Weasley -- elbow grease."

    Ron gulped. Argus Filch, the caretaker, was loathed by every student in the school.

  "And you, Potter, will be helping Professor Lockhart answer his fan mail," said Professor
McGonagall.

    "Oh n-- Professor, can't I go and do the trophy room, too?" said Harry desperately.

   "Certainly not," said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows. "Professor Lockhart requested
you particularly. Eight o'clock sharp, both of you."

   Harry and Ron slouched into the Great Hall in states of deepest gloom, Hermione behind them,
wearing a well-you-did-break-school-rules sort of expression. Harry didn't enjoy his shepherd's pie as
much as he'd thought. Both he and Ron felt they'd got the worse deal.

     "Filch'll have me there all night," said Ron heavily. "No magic! There must be about a hundred cups
in that room. I'm no good at Muggle cleaning."


                                                                                                           Page 68

   "I'd swap anytime," said Harry hollowly. "I've had loads of practice with the Dursleys. Answering
Lockhart's fan mail...he'll be a nightmare...."

    Saturday afternoon seemed to melt away, and in what seemed like no time, it was five minutes to
eight, and Harry was dragging his feet along the second-floor corridor to Lockhart's office. He gritted his
teeth and knocked.

    The door flew open at once. Lockhart beamed down at him.

    "Ah, here's the scalawag!" he said. "Come in, Harry, come in --"

   Shining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles were countless framed photographs of
Lockhart. He had even signed a few of them. Another large pile lay on his desk.

    "You can address the envelopes!" Lockhart told Harry, as though this was a huge treat.

    "This first one's to Gladys Gudgeon, bless her -- huge fan of mine --"

     The minutes snailed by. Harry let Lockhart's voice wash over him, occasionally saying, "Mmm" and
"Right" and "Yeah." Now and then he caught a phrase like, "Fame's a fickle friend, Harry," or "Celebrity
is as celebrity does, remember that."

    The candles burned lower and lower, making the light dance over the many moving faces of Lockhart
watching him. Harry moved his aching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope, writing out
Veronica Smethley's address. It must be nearly time to leave , Harry thought miserably, please let it
be nearly time...

   And then he heard something -- something quite apart from the spitting of the dying candles and
Lockhart's prattle about his fans.

    It was a voice, a voice to chill the bone marrow, a voice of breathtaking, ice-cold venom.

    "Come...come to me....Let me rip you....Let me tear you....Let me kill you...."

    Harry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on Veronica Smethley's street.

    " What?" he said loudly.

    "I know!" said Lockhart. "Six solid months at the top of the best-seller list! Broke all records!"

    "No," said Harry frantically. "That voice!"

    "Sorry?" said Lockhart, looking puzzled. "What voice?"

    "That -- that voice that said -- didn't you hear it?"

    Lockhart was looking at Harry in high astonishment.

     "What are you talking about, Harry? Perhaps you're getting a little drowsy? Great Scott -- look at
the time! We've been here nearly four hours! I'd never have believed it -- the time's flown, hasn't it?"


                                                                                                              Page 69

   Harry didn't answer. He was straining his ears to hear the voice again, but there was no sound now
except for Lockhart telling him he mustn't expect a treat like this every time he got detention. Feeling
dazed, Harry left.

     It was so late that the Gryffindor common room was almost empty. Harry went straight up to the
dormitory. Ron wasn't back yet. Harry pulled on his pajamas, got into bed, and waited. Half an hour
later, Ron arrived, nursing his right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish into the darkened room.

    "My muscles have all seized up," he groaned, sinking on his bed. "Fourteen times he made me buff
up that Quidditch cup before he was satisfied. And then I had another slug attack all over a Special
Award for Services to the School. Took ages to get the slime off...How was it with Lockhart?"

   Keeping his voice low so as not to wake Neville, Dean, and Seamus, Harry told Ron exactly what he
had heard.

   "And Lockhart said he couldn't hear it?" said Ron. Harry could see him frowning in the moonlight.
"D'you think he was lying? But I don't get it -- even someone invisible would've had to open the door."

      "I know," said Harry, lying back in his four-poster and staring at the canopy above him. "I don't get
it either."




                                            CHAPTER EIGHT



                                       THE DEATHDAY PARTY

 October arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle. Madam Pomfrey, the
nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students. Her Pepperup potion
worked instantly, though it left the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward. Ginny
Weasley, who had been looking pale, was bullied into taking some by Percy. The steam pouring from
under her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole head was on fire. Raindrops the size of bullets
thundered on the castle windows for days on end; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy
streams, and Hagrid's pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds. Oliver Wood's enthusiasm for
regular training sessions, however, was not dampened, which was why Harry was to be found, late one
stormy Saturday afternoon a few days before Halloween, returning to Gryffindor Tower, drenched to the
skin and splattered with mud.

    Even aside from the rain and wind it hadn't been a happy practice session. Fred and George, who
had been spying on the Slytherin team, had seen for themselves the speed of those new Nimbus Two
Thousand and Ones. They reported that the Slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs,
shooting through the air like missiles. As Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across
somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was. Nearly Headless Nick, the ghost of Gryffindor
Tower, was staring morosely out of a window, muttering under his breath, "...don't fulfill their
requirements...half an inch, if that..."


                                                                                                              Page 70

    "Hello, Nick," said Harry.

    "Hello, hello," said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and looking round. He wore a dashing, plumed
hat on his long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff, which concealed the fact that his neck was almost
completely severed. He was pale as smoke, and Harry could see right through him to the dark sky and
torrential rain outside.

    "You look troubled, young Potter," said Nick, folding a transparent letter as he spoke and tucking it
inside his doublet.

    "So do you," said Harry.

     "Ah," Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand, "a matter of no importance...It's not as though
I really wanted to join...Thought I'd apply, but apparently I `don't fulfill requirements' --"

    In spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great bitterness on his face.

    "But you would think, wouldn't you," he erupted suddenly, pulling the letter back out of his pocket,
"that getting hit forty-five times in the neck with a blunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless Hunt?"

    "Oh -- yes," said Harry, who was obviously supposed to agree.

    "I mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all been quick and clean, and my head had come
off properly, I mean, it would have saved me a great deal of pain and ridicule. However --" Nearly
Headless Nick shook his letter open and read furiously:



 "`We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have parted company with their bodies. You will
appreciate that it would be impossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such as
Horseback Head-Juggling and Head Polo. It is with the greatest regret, therefore, that I must inform you
that you do not fulfill our requirements. With very best wishes, Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore.'"



Fuming, Nearly Headless Nick stuffed the letter away.

   "Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, Harry! Most people would think that's good and
beheaded, but oh, no, it's not enough for Sir Properly Decapitated-Podmore."

    Nearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and then said, in a far calmer tone, "So -- what's
bothering you? Anything I can do?"

   "No," said Harry. "Not unless you know where we can get seven free Nimbus Two Thousand and
Ones for our match against Sly--"

    The rest of Harry's sentence was drowned out by a high-pitched mewling from somewhere near his
ankles. He looked down and found himself gazing into a pair of lamp-like yellow eyes. It was Mrs.
Norris, the skeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker, Argus Filch, as a sort of deputy in his
endless battle against students.


                                                                                                                Page 71

     "You'd better get out of here, Harry," said Nick quickly. "Filch isn't in a good mood -- he's got the
flu and some third years accidentally plastered frog brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five. He's been
cleaning all morning, and if he sees you dripping mud all over the place --"

     "Right," said Harry, backing away from the accusing stare of Mrs. Norris, but not quickly enough.
Drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to connect him with his foul cat, Argus Filch
burst suddenly through a tapestry to Harry's right, wheezing and looking wildly about for the
rule-breaker. There was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head, and his nose was unusually purple.

     "Filth!" he shouted, his jowls aquiver, his eyes popping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy puddle
that had dripped from Harry's Quidditch robes. "Mess and muck everywhere! I've had enough of it, I
tell you! Follow me, Potter!"

    So Harry waved a gloomy good-bye to Nearly Headless Nick and followed Filch back downstairs,
doubling the number of muddy footprints on the floor. Harry had never been inside Filch's office before;
it was a place most students avoided. The room was dingy and windowless, lit by a single oil lamp
dangling from the low ceiling. A faint smell of fried fish lingered about the place. Wooden filing cabinets
stood around the walls; from their labels, Harry could see that they contained details of every pupil Filch
had ever punished. Fred and George Weasley had an entire drawer to themselves. A highly polished
collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind Filch's desk. It was common knowledge that
he was always begging Dumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling.

    Filch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling around looking for parchment.

   "Dung," he muttered furiously, "great sizzling dragon bogies...frog brains...rat intestines...I've had
enough of it...make an example...where's the form...yes..."

    He retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched it out in front of him,
dipping his long black quill into the ink pot.

    " Name...Harry Potter. Crime ..."

    "It was only a bit of mud!" said Harry.

    "It's only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me it's an extra hour scrubbing!" shouted Filch, a drip
shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose. " Crime...befouling the castle... suggested
sentence..."

     Dabbing at his streaming nose, Filch squinted unpleasantly at Harry who waited with bated breath for
his sentence to fall.

     But as Filch lowered his quill, there was a great BANG! on the ceiling of the office, which made the
oil lamp rattle.

   "PEEVES!" Filch roared, flinging down his quill in a transport of rage. "I'll have you this time, I'll
have you!"

    And without a backward glance at Harry, Filch ran flat-footed from the office, Mrs. Norris streaking
alongside him.




                                                                                                              Page 72

     Peeves was the school poltergeist, a grinning, airborne menace who lived to cause havoc and
distress. Harry didn't much like Peeves, but couldn't help feeling grateful for his timing. Hopefully,
whatever Peeves had done (and it sounded as though he'd wrecked something very big this time) would
distract Filch from Harry.

    Thinking that he should probably wait for Filch to come back, Harry sank into a moth-eaten chair
next to the desk. There was only one thing on it apart from his half-completed form: a large, glossy,
purple envelope with silver lettering on the front. With a quick glance at the door to check that Filch
wasn't on his way back, Harry picked up the envelope and read:



                                                 Kwikspell

                             A Correspondence Course in Beginners' Magic.



    Intrigued, Harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside. More curly
silver writing on the front page said:



 Feel out of step in the world of modern magic? Find yourself making excuses not to perform simple
spells? Ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork?

 There is an answer!



Kwikspell is an all-new, fail-safe, quick-result, easy-learn course. Hundreds of witches and wizards
have benefited from the Kwikspell method!



Madam Z. Nettles of Topsham writes:

 "I had no memory for incantations and my potions were a family joke! Now, after a Kwikspell course, I
am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of my Scintillation Solution!"

Warlock D. J. Prod of Didsbury says:

 "My wife used to sneer at my feeble charms, but one month into your fabulous Kwikspell course and I
succeeded in turning her into a yak! Thank you, Kwikspell!"



   Fascinated, Harry thumbed through the rest of the envelope's contents. Why on earth did Filch want
a Kwikspell course? Did this mean he wasn't a proper wizard? Harry was just reading "Lesson One:
Holding Your Wand (Some Useful Tips)" when shuffling footsteps outside told him Filch was coming
back. Stuffing the parchment back into the envelope, Harry threw it back onto the desk just as the door


                                                                                                          Page 73

opened.

    Filch was looking triumphant.

   "That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable!" he was saying gleefully to Mrs. Norris. "We'll have
Peeves out this time, my sweet --"

    His eyes fell on Harry and then darted to the Kwikspell envelope, which, Harry realized too late, was
lying two feet away from where it had started.

    Filch's pasty face went brick red. Harry braced himself for a tidal wave of fury. Filch hobbled across
to his desk, snatched up the envelope, and threw it into a drawer.

    "Have you -- did you read --?" he sputtered.

    "No," Harry lied quickly.

    Filch's knobbly hands were twisting together.

   "If I thought you'd read my private --not that it's mine -- for a friend -- be that as it may --
however --"

    Harry was staring at him, alarmed; Filch had never looked madder. His eyes were popping, a tic was
going in one of his pouchy cheeks, and the tartan scarf didn't help.

   "Very well -- go -- and don't breathe a word -- not that -- however, if you didn't read -- go
now, I have to write up Peeves' report -- go --"

    Amazed at his luck, Harry sped out of the office, up the corridor, and back upstairs. To escape from
Filch's office without punishment was probably some kind of school record.

    "Harry! Harry! Did it work?"

     Nearly Headless Nick came gliding out of a classroom. Behind him, Harry could see the wreckage of
a large black-and-gold cabinet that appeared to have been dropped from a great height.

   "I persuaded Peeves to crash it right over Filch's office," said Nick eagerly. "Thought it might distract
him --"

   "Was that you?" said Harry gratefully. "Yeah, it worked, I didn't even get detention. Thanks,
Nick!"

    They set off up the corridor together. Nearly Headless Nick, Harry noticed, was still holding Sir
Patrick's rejection letter...

    "I wish there was something I could do for you about the Headless Hunt," Harry said. Nearly
Headless Nick stopped in his tracks and Harry walked right through him. He wished he hadn't; it was
like stepping through an icy shower.

   "But there is something you could do for me," said Nick excitedly. "Harry -- would I be asking too
much -- but no, you wouldn't want --"


                                                                                                               Page 74

   "What is it?" said Harry. "Well, this Halloween will be my five hundredth deathday," said Nearly
Headless Nick, drawing himself up and looking dignified.

    "Oh," said Harry, not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this. "Right."

    "I'm holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons. Friends will be coming from all over the
country. It would be such an honor if you would attend. Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger would be most
welcome, too, of course -- but I daresay you'd rather go to the school feast?" He watched Harry on
tenterhooks.

    "No," said Harry quickly, "I'll come --"

   "My dear boy! Harry Potter, at my deathday party! And --" he hesitated, looking excited "-- do
you think you could possibly mention to Sir Patrick how very frightening and impressive you find me?"

    "Of -- of course," said Harry.

    Nearly Headless Nick beamed at him.



 "A deathday party?" said Hermione keenly when Harry had changed at last and joined her and Ron in
the common room. "I bet there aren't many living people who can say they've been to one of those --
it'll be fascinating!"

    "Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died?" said Ron, who was halfway through his
Potions homework and grumpy. "Sounds dead depressing to me..."



 Rain was still lashing the windows, which were now inky black, but inside all looked bright and cheerful.
The firelight glowed over the countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing
homework or, in the case of Fred and George Weasley, trying to find out what would happen if you fed
a Filibuster firework to a salamander. Fred had "rescued" the brilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard from a
Care of Magical Creatures class and it was now smouldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of
curious people.

    Harry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione about Filch and the Kwikspell course when the
salamander suddenly whizzed into the air, emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the
room. The sight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at Fred and George, the spectacular display of
tangerine stars showering from the salamander's mouth, and its escape into the fire, with accompanying
explosions, drove both Filch and the Kwikspell envelope from Harry's mind.



 By the time Halloween arrived, Harry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party. The
rest of the school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast; the Great Hall had been decorated with
the usual live bats, Hagrid's vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for three men to
sit in, and there were rumors that Dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the
entertainment.


                                                                                                              Page 75

    "A promise is a promise," Hermione reminded Harry bossily. "You said you'd go to the deathday
party."

   So at seven o'clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked straight past the doorway to the packed
Great Hall, which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles, and directed their steps instead
toward the dungeons.

    The passageway leading to Nearly Headless Nick's party had been lined with candles, too, though
the effect was far from cheerful: These were long, thin, jet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a
dim, ghostly light even over their own living faces. The temperature dropped with every step they took.
As Harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him, he heard what sounded like a thousand
fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard.

   "Is that supposed to be music ?" Ron whispered. They turned a corner and saw Nearly Headless
Nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes.

    "My dear friends," he said mournfully. "Welcome, welcome...so pleased you could come..."

    He swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside.

    It was an incredible sight. The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-white, translucent people,
mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor, waltzing to the dreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical
saws, played by an orchestra on a raised, black-draped platform. A chandelier overhead blazed
midnight-blue with a thousand more black candles. Their breath rose in a mist before them; it was like
stepping into a freezer.

    "Shall we have a look around?" Harry suggested, wanting to warm up his feet.

    "Careful not to walk through anyone," said Ron nervously, and they set off around the edge of the
dance floor. They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a ragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a
cheerful Hufflepuff ghost, who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead. Harry
wasn't surprised to see that the Bloody Baron, a gaunt, staring Slytherin ghost covered in silver
bloodstains, was being given a wide berth by the other ghosts.

   "Oh, no," said Hermione, stopping abruptly. "Turn back, turn back, I don't want to talk to Moaning
Myrtle --"

    "Who?" said Harry as they backtracked quickly.

    "She haunts one of the toilets in the girls' bathroom on the first floor," said Hermione.

    "She haunts a toilet ?"

   "Yes. It's been out-of-order all year because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place. I
never went in there anyway if I could avoid it; it's awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you --"

    "Look, food!" said Ron.

   On the other side of the dungeon was a long table, also covered in black velvet. They approached it
eagerly but next moment had stopped in their tracks, horrified. The smell was quite disgusting. Large,


                                                                                                                Page 76

rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters; cakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped on salvers;
there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of cheese covered in furry green mold and, in pride of place, an
enormous gray cake in the shape of a tombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words,



                             SIR NICHOLAS DE MIMSY-PORPINGTON

                                      DIED 31ST OCTOBER, 1492



     Harry watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table, crouched low, and walked through
it, his mouth held wide so that it passed through one of the stinking salmon.

    "Can you taste it if you walk though it?" Harry asked him.

    "Almost," said the ghost sadly, and he drifted away.

   "I expect they've let it rot to give it a stronger flavor," said Hermione knowledgeably, pinching her
nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid haggis.

    "Can we move? I feel sick," said Ron.

    They had barely turned around, however, when a little man swooped suddenly from under the table
and came to a halt in midair before them.

    "Hello, Peeves," said Harry cautiously.

    Unlike the ghosts around them, Peeves the Poltergeist was the very reverse of pale and transparent.
He was wearing a bright orange party hat, a revolving bow tie, and a broad grin on his wide, wicked
face.

    "Nibbles?" he said sweetly, offering them a bowl of peanuts covered in fungus.

    "No thanks," said Hermione.

  "Heard you talking about poor Myrtle," said Peeves, his eyes dancing. " Rudeyou was about poor
Myrtle." He took a deep breath and bellowed, "OY! MYRTLE!"

    "Oh, no, Peeves, don't tell her what I said, she'll be really upset," Hermione whispered frantically. "I
didn't mean it, I don't mind her -- er, hello, Myrtle."

    The squat ghost of a girl had glided over. She had the glummest face Harry had ever seen,
half-hidden behind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles.

    "What?" she said sulkily.

     "How are you, Myrtle?" said Hermione in a falsely bright voice. "It's nice to see you out of the
toilet."




                                                                                                               Page 77

    Myrtle sniffed.

    "Miss Granger was just talking about you --" said Peeves slyly in Myrtle's ear. "Just saying --"

    "Just saying -- saying -- how nice you look tonight," said Hermione, glaring at Peeves.

    Myrtle eyed Hermione suspiciously.

    "You're making fun of me," she said, silver tears welling rapidly in her small, see-through eyes.

   "No -- honestly -- didn't I just say how nice Myrtle's looking?" said Hermione, nudging Harry and
Ron painfully in the ribs.

    "Oh, yeah --"

    "She did --"

   "Don't lie to me," Myrtle gasped, tears now flooding down her face, while Peeves chuckled happily
over her shoulder. "D'you think I don't know what people call me behind my back? Fat Myrtle! Ugly
Myrtle! Miserable, moaning, moping Myrtle!"

    "You've forgotten pimply," Peeves hissed in her ear.

    Moaning Myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon. Peeves shot after her, pelting
her with moldy peanuts, yelling, " Pimply! Pimply!"

    "Oh, dear," said Hermione sadly.

    Nearly Headless Nick now drifted toward them through the crowd.

    "Enjoying yourselves?"

    "Oh, yes," they lied.

    "Not a bad turnout," said Nearly Headless Nick proudly. "The Wailing Widow came all the way up
from Kent...It's nearly time for my speech, I'd better go and warn the orchestra..."

   The orchestra, however, stopped playing at that very moment. They, and everyone else in the
dungeon, fell silent, looking around in excitement, as a hunting horn sounded.

    "Oh, here we go," said Nearly Headless Nick bitterly.

    Through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses, each ridden by a headless horseman. The
assembly clapped wildly; Harry started to clap, too, but stopped quickly at the sight of Nick's face.

     The horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted, rearing and plunging. At the front
of the pack was a large ghost who held his bearded head under his arm, from which position he was
blowing the horn. The ghost leapt down, lifted his head high in the air so he could see over the crowd
(everyone laughed), and strode over to Nearly Headless Nick, squashing his head back onto his neck.

    "Nick!" he roared. "How are you? Head still hanging in there?"


                                                                                                             Page 78

      He gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Nearly Headless Nick on the shoulder.

      "Welcome, Patrick," said Nick stiffly.

    "Live 'uns!" said Sir Patrick, spotting Harry, Ron, and Hermione and giving a huge, fake jump of
astonishment, so that his head fell off again (the crowd howled with laughter).

      "Very amusing," said Nearly Headless Nick darkly.

   "Don't mind Nick!" shouted Sir Patrick's head from the floor. "Still upset we won't let him join the
Hunt! But I mean to say -- look at the fellow --"

      "I think," said Harry hurriedly, at a meaningful look from Nick, "Nick's very -- frightening and -- er
--"

      "Ha!" yelled Sir Patrick's head.

      "Bet he asked you to say that!"

     "If I could have everyone's attention, it's time for my speech!" said Nearly Headless Nick loudly,
striding toward the podium and climbing into an icy blue spotlight.

      "My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is my great sorrow..."

    But nobody heard much more. Sir Patrick and the rest of the Headless Hunt had just started a game
of Head Hockey and the crowd were turning to watch. Nearly Headless Nick tried vainly to recapture
his audience, but gave up as Sir Patrick's head went sailing past him to loud cheers.

      Harry was very cold by now, not to mention hungry.

    "I can't stand much more of this," Ron muttered, his teeth chattering, as the orchestra ground back
into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance floor.

      "Let's go," Harry agreed.

    They backed toward the door, nodding and beaming at anyone who looked at them, and a minute
later were hurrying back up the passageway full of black candles.

    "Pudding might not be finished yet," said Ron hopefully, leading the way toward the steps to the
entrance hall.

      And then Harry heard it.

      "... rip... tear... kill..."

      It was the same voice, the same cold, murderous voice he had heard in Lockhart's office.

    He stumbled to a halt, clutching at the stone wall, listening with all his might, looking around, squinting
up and down the dimly lit passageway.




                                                                                                                  Page 79

    "Harry, what're you --?"

    "It's that voice again -- shut up a minute --"

    "... soo hungry... for so long..."

    "Listen!" said Harry urgently, and Ron and Hermione froze, watching him.

    "... kill... time to kill..."

    The voice was growing fainter. Harry was sure it was moving away -- moving upward. A mixture of
fear and excitement gripped him as he stared at the dark ceiling; how could it be moving upward? Was it
a phantom, to whom stone ceilings didn't matter?

    "This way," he shouted, and he began to run, up the stairs, into the entrance hall. It was no good
hoping to hear anything here, the babble of talk from the Halloween feast was echoing out of the Great
Hall. Harry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first floor, Ron and Hermione clattering behind him.

    "Harry, what're we --"

    "SHH!"

    Harry strained his ears. Distantly, from the floor above, and growing fainter still, he heard the voice:
"... I smell blood... I SMELL BLOOD!"

    His stomach lurched --

    "It's going to kill someone!" he shouted, and ignoring Ron's and Hermione's bewildered faces, he
ran up the next flight of steps three at a time, trying to listen over his own pounding footsteps -- Harry
hurtled around the whole of the second floor, Ron and Hermione panting behind him, not stopping until
they turned a corner into the last, deserted passage.

    "Harry, what was that all about?" said Ron, wiping sweat off his face. "I couldn't hear anything..."

    But Hermione gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the corridor.

    " Look!"

    Something was shining on the wall ahead. They approached slowly, squinting through the darkness.
Foot-high words had been daubed on the wall between two windows, shimmering in the light cast by the
flaming torches.



                               THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN

                             OPENED. ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE



    "What's that thing -- hanging underneath?" said Ron, a slight quiver in his voice.


                                                                                                               Page 80

     As they edged nearer, Harry almost slipped -- there was a large puddle of water on the floor; Ron
and Hermione grabbed him, and they inched toward the message, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath
it. All three of them realized what it was at once, and leapt backward with a splash.

   Mrs. Norris, the caretaker's cat, was hanging by her tail from the torch bracket. She was stiff as a
board, her eyes wide and staring.

    For a few seconds, they didn't move. Then Ron said, "Let's get out of here."

    "Shouldn't we try and help --" Harry began awkwardly.

    "Trust me," said Ron. "We don't want to be found here."

    But it was too late. A rumble, as though of distant thunder, told them that the feast had just ended.
From either end of the corridor where they stood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs,
and the loud, happy talk of well-fed people; next moment, students were crashing into the passage from
both ends.

    The chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted the hanging cat. Harry,
Ron, and Hermione stood alone, in the middle of the corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students
pressing forward to see the grisly sight.

    Then someone shouted through the quiet.

    "Enemies of the Heir, beware! You'll be next, Mudbloods!"

    It was Draco Malfoy. He had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyes alive, his usually
bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the hanging, immobile cat.

THE WRITING ON THE WALL



What's going on here? What's going on?"

   Attracted no doubt by Malfoy's shout, Argus Filch came shouldering his way through the crowd.
Then he saw Mrs. Norris and fell back, clutching his face in horror.

    "My cat! My cat! What's happened to Mrs. Norris?" he shrieked.

    And his popping eyes fell on Harry.


                                                                                                              Page 81

    " You!"he screeched. " You! You've murdered my cat! You've killed her! I'll kill you! I'll --"

    " Argus!"

   Dumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a number of other teachers. In seconds, he had
swept past Harry, Ron, and Hermione and detached Mrs. Norris from the torch bracket.

    "Come with me, Argus," he said to Filch. "You, too, Mr. Potter, Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger."

    Lockhart stepped forward eagerly.

    "My office is nearest, Headmaster -- just upstairs -- please feel free --"

    "Thank you, Gilderoy," said Dumbledore.

  The silent crowd parted to let them pass. Lockhart, looking excited and important, hurried after
Dumbledore; so did Professors McGonagall and Snape.

    As they entered Lockhart's darkened office there was a flurry of movement across the walls; Harry
saw several of the Lockharts in the pictures dodging out of sight, their hair in rollers. The real Lockhart lit
the candles on his desk and stood back. Dumbledore lay Mrs. Norris on the polished surface and began
to examine her. Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool
of candlelight, watching.

    The tip of Dumbledore's long, crooked nose was barely an inch from Mrs. Norris's fur. He was
looking at her closely through his half-moon spectacles, his long fingers gently prodding and poking.
Professor McGonagall was bent almost as close, her eyes narrowed. Snape loomed behind them, half in
shadow, wearing a most peculiar expression: It was as though he was trying hard not to smile. And
Lockhart was hovering around all of them, making suggestions.

   "It was definitely a curse that killed her -- probably the Transmogrifian Torture -- I've seen it used
many times, so unlucky I wasn't there, I know the very countercurse that would have saved her...."

    Lockhart's comments were punctuated by Filch's dry, racking sobs. He was slumped in a chair by
the desk, unable to look at Mrs. Norris, his face in his hands. Much as he detested Filch, Harry couldn't
help feeling a bit sorry for him, though not nearly as sorry as he felt for himself If Dumbledore believed
Filch, he would be expelled for sure.

   Dumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath and tapping Mrs. Norris with his
wand but nothing happened. She continued to look as though she had been recently stuffed.

    "...I remember something very similar happening in Ouagadogou," said Lockhart, "a series of
attacks, the full story's in my autobiography, I was able to provide the townsfolk with various amulets,
which cleared the matter up at once...."

    The photographs of Lockhart on the walls were all nodding in agreement as he talked. One of them
had forgotten to remove his hair net.

    At last Dumbledore straightened up.




                                                                                                                  Page 82

    "She's not dead, Argus," he said softly.

    Lockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of murders he had prevented.

    "Not dead?" choked Filch, looking through his fingers at Mrs. Norris. "But why's she all -- all stiff
and frozen?"

   "She has been Petrified," said Dumbledore ("Ah! I thought so!" said Lockhart). "But how, I cannot
say..."

    "Ask him !" shrieked Filch, turning his blotched and tearstained face to Harry.

   "No second year could have done this," said Dumbledore firmly. "it would take Dark Magic of the
most advanced --"

    "He did it, he did it!" Filch spat, his pouchy face purpling. "You saw what he wrote on the wall! He
found -- in my office -- he knows I'm a -- I'm a --" Filch's face worked horribly. "He knows I'm a
Squib!" he finished.

    "I never touched Mrs. Norris!" Harry said loudly, uncomfortably aware of everyone looking at him,
including all the Lockharts on the walls. "And I don't even know what a Squib is ."

    "Rubbish!" snarled Filch. "He saw my Kwikspell letter!"

    "If I might speak, Headmaster," said Snape from the shadows, and Harry's sense of foreboding
increased; he was sure nothing Snape had to say was going to do him any good.

    "Potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time," he said, a slight
sneer curling his mouth as though he doubted it. "But we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here.
Why was he in the upstairs corridor at all? Why wasn't he at the Halloween feast?"

   Harry, Ron and Hermione all launched into an explanation about the deathday party. "...there were
hundreds of ghosts, they'll tell you we were there --"

    "But why not join the feast afterward?" said Snape, his black eyes glittering in the candlelight. "Why
go up to that corridor?"

    Ron and Hermione looked at Harry.

    "Because -- because --" Harry said, his heart thumping very fast; something told him it would sound
very far-fetched if he told them he had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear,
"because we were tired and wanted to go to bed," he said.

   "Without any supper?" said Snape, a triumphant smile flickering across his gaunt face. "I didn't think
ghosts provided food fit for living people at their parties."

    "We weren't hungry," said Ron loudly as his stomach gave a huge rumble.

    Snape's nasty smile widened.

    "I suggest, Headmaster, that Potter is not being entirely truthful," he said. "It might be a good idea if
