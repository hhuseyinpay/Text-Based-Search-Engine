The Ebb-tide RunsTHE coracle--as I had ample reason to know before I was done withher--was a very safe boat for a person of my height and weight, bothbuoyant and clever in a seaway; but she was the most cross-grained,lop-sided craft to manage. Do as you pleased, she always made moreleeway than anything else, and turning round and round was the manoeuvreshe was best at. Even Ben Gunn himself has admitted that she was "queerto handle till you knew her way."Certainly I did not know her way. She turned in every direction but theone I was bound to go; the most part of the time we were broadside on,and I am very sure I never should have made the ship at all but for thetide. By good fortune, paddle as I pleased, the tide was still sweepingme down; and there lay the HISPANIOLA right in the fairway, hardly to bemissed.First she loomed before me like a blot of something yet blacker thandarkness, then her spars and hull began to take shape, and the nextmoment, as it seemed (for, the farther I went, the brisker grew thecurrent of the ebb), I was alongside of her hawser and had laid hold.The hawser was as taut as a bowstring, and the current so strong shepulled upon her anchor. All round the hull, in the blackness, therippling current bubbled and chattered like a little mountain stream.One cut with my sea-gully and the HISPANIOLA would go humming down thetide.So far so good, but it next occurred to my recollection that a tauthawser, suddenly cut, is a thing as dangerous as a kicking horse. Ten toone, if I were so foolhardy as to cut the HISPANIOLA from her anchor, Iand the coracle would be knocked clean out of the water.This brought me to a full stop, and if fortune had not againparticularly favoured me, I should have had to abandon my design. Butthe light airs which had begun blowing from the south-east and southhad hauled round after nightfall into the south-west. Just while I wasmeditating, a puff came, caught the HISPANIOLA, and forced her up intothe current; and to my great joy, I felt the hawser slacken in my grasp,and the hand by which I held it dip for a second under water.With that I made my mind up, took out my gully, opened it with my teeth,and cut one strand after another, till the vessel swung only by two.Then I lay quiet, waiting to sever these last when the strain should beonce more lightened by a breath of wind.All this time I had heard the sound of loud voices from the cabin, butto say truth, my mind had been so entirely taken up with other thoughtsthat I had scarcely given ear. Now, however, when I had nothing else todo, I began to pay more heed.One I recognized for the coxswain's, Israel Hands, that had been Flint'sgunner in former days. The other was, of course, my friend of the rednight-cap. Both men were plainly the worse of drink, and they were stilldrinking, for even while I was listening, one of them, with a drunkencry, opened the stern window and threw out something, which I divined tobe an empty bottle. But they were not only tipsy; it was plain that theywere furiously angry. Oaths flew like hailstones, and every now andthen there came forth such an explosion as I thought was sure to endin blows. But each time the quarrel passed off and the voices grumbledlower for a while, until the next crisis came and in its turn passedaway without result.On shore, I could see the glow of the great camp-fire burning warmlythrough the shore-side trees. Someone was singing, a dull, old, droningsailor's song, with a droop and a quaver at the end of every verse,and seemingly no end to it at all but the patience of the singer. I hadheard it on the voyage more than once and remembered these words:     "But one man of her crew alive,     What put to sea with seventy-five."And I thought it was a ditty rather too dolefully appropriate for acompany that had met such cruel losses in the morning. But, indeed, fromwhat I saw, all these buccaneers were as callous as the sea they sailedon.At last the breeze came; the schooner sidled and drew nearer in thedark; I felt the hawser slacken once more, and with a good, tougheffort, cut the last fibres through.The breeze had but little action on the coracle, and I was almostinstantly swept against the bows of the HISPANIOLA. At the same time,the schooner began to turn upon her heel, spinning slowly, end for end,across the current.I wrought like a fiend, for I expected every moment to be swamped; andsince I found I could not push the coracle directly off, I now shovedstraight astern. At length I was clear of my dangerous neighbour, andjust as I gave the last impulsion, my hands came across a light cordthat was trailing overboard across the stern bulwarks. Instantly Igrasped it.Why I should have done so I can hardly say. It was at first mereinstinct, but once I had it in my hands and found it fast, curiositybegan to get the upper hand, and I determined I should have one lookthrough the cabin window.I pulled in hand over hand on the cord, and when I judged myself nearenough, rose at infinite risk to about half my height and thus commandedthe roof and a slice of the interior of the cabin.By this time the schooner and her little consort were gliding prettyswiftly through the water; indeed, we had already fetched up level withthe camp-fire. The ship was talking, as sailors say, loudly, treadingthe innumerable ripples with an incessant weltering splash; and until Igot my eye above the window-sill I could not comprehend why the watchmenhad taken no alarm. One glance, however, was sufficient; and it wasonly one glance that I durst take from that unsteady skiff. It showed meHands and his companion locked together in deadly wrestle, each with ahand upon the other's throat.I dropped upon the thwart again, none too soon, for I was nearoverboard. I could see nothing for the moment but these two furious,encrimsoned faces swaying together under the smoky lamp, and I shut myeyes to let them grow once more familiar with the darkness.The endless ballad had come to an end at last, and the whole diminishedcompany about the camp-fire had broken into the chorus I had heard sooften:          "Fifteen men on the dead man's chest--              Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!           Drink and the devil had done for the rest--              Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!"I was just thinking how busy drink and the devil were at that verymoment in the cabin of the HISPANIOLA, when I was surprised by a suddenlurch of the coracle. At the same moment, she yawed sharply and seemedto change her course. The speed in the meantime had strangely increased.I opened my eyes at once. All round me were little ripples, combingover with a sharp, bristling sound and slightly phosphorescent. TheHISPANIOLA herself, a few yards in whose wake I was still being whirledalong, seemed to stagger in her course, and I saw her spars toss alittle against the blackness of the night; nay, as I looked longer, Imade sure she also was wheeling to the southward.I glanced over my shoulder, and my heart jumped against my ribs. There,right behind me, was the glow of the camp-fire. The current had turnedat right angles, sweeping round along with it the tall schooner andthe little dancing coracle; ever quickening, ever bubbling higher, evermuttering louder, it went spinning through the narrows for the open sea.Suddenly the schooner in front of me gave a violent yaw, turning,perhaps, through twenty degrees; and almost at the same moment oneshout followed another from on board; I could hear feet pounding onthe companion ladder and I knew that the two drunkards had at last beeninterrupted in their quarrel and awakened to a sense of their disaster.I lay down flat in the bottom of that wretched skiff and devoutlyrecommended my spirit to its Maker. At the end of the straits, Imade sure we must fall into some bar of raging breakers, where all mytroubles would be ended speedily; and though I could, perhaps, bear todie, I could not bear to look upon my fate as it approached.So I must have lain for hours, continually beaten to and fro upon thebillows, now and again wetted with flying sprays, and never ceasing toexpect death at the next plunge. Gradually weariness grew upon me; anumbness, an occasional stupor, fell upon my mind even in the midst ofmy terrors, until sleep at last supervened and in my sea-tossed coracleI lay and dreamed of home and the old Admiral Benbow.24The Cruise of the CoracleIT was broad day when I awoke and found myself tossing at the south-westend of Treasure Island. The sun was up but was still hid from me behindthe great bulk of the Spy-glass, which on this side descended almost tothe sea in formidable cliffs.Haulbowline Head and Mizzen-mast Hill were at my elbow, the hill bareand dark, the head bound with cliffs forty or fifty feet high andfringed with great masses of fallen rock. I was scarce a quarter of amile to seaward, and it was my first thought to paddle in and land.That notion was soon given over. Among the fallen rocks the breakersspouted and bellowed; loud reverberations, heavy sprays flying andfalling, succeeded one another from second to second; and I saw myself,if I ventured nearer, dashed to death upon the rough shore or spendingmy strength in vain to scale the beetling crags.Nor was that all, for crawling together on flat tables of rock orletting themselves drop into the sea with loud reports I beheld hugeslimy monsters--soft snails, as it were, of incredible bigness--twoor three score of them together, making the rocks to echo with theirbarkings.I have understood since that they were sea lions, and entirely harmless.But the look of them, added to the difficulty of the shore and thehigh running of the surf, was more than enough to disgust me of thatlanding-place. I felt willing rather to starve at sea than to confrontsuch perils.In the meantime I had a better chance, as I supposed, before me. Northof Haulbowline Head, the land runs in a long way, leaving at low tidea long stretch of yellow sand. To the north of that, again, there comesanother cape--Cape of the Woods, as it was marked upon the chart--buriedin tall green pines, which descended to the margin of the sea.I remembered what Silver had said about the current that sets northwardalong the whole west coast of Treasure Island, and seeing from myposition that I was already under its influence, I preferred to leaveHaulbowline Head behind me and reserve my strength for an attempt toland upon the kindlier-looking Cape of the Woods.There was a great, smooth swell upon the sea. The wind blowing steadyand gentle from the south, there was no contrariety between that and thecurrent, and the billows rose and fell unbroken.Had it been otherwise, I must long ago have perished; but as it was,it is surprising how easily and securely my little and light boat couldride. Often, as I still lay at the bottom and kept no more than an eyeabove the gunwale, I would see a big blue summit heaving close above me;yet the coracle would but bounce a little, dance as if on springs, andsubside on the other side into the trough as lightly as a bird.I began after a little to grow very bold and sat up to try my skill atpaddling. But even a small change in the disposition of the weight willproduce violent changes in the behaviour of a coracle. And I had hardlymoved before the boat, giving up at once her gentle dancing movement,ran straight down a slope of water so steep that it made me giddy, andstruck her nose, with a spout of spray, deep into the side of the nextwave.I was drenched and terrified, and fell instantly back into my oldposition, whereupon the coracle seemed to find her head again and ledme as softly as before among the billows. It was plain she was not to beinterfered with, and at that rate, since I could in no way influence hercourse, what hope had I left of reaching land?I began to be horribly frightened, but I kept my head, for all that.First, moving with all care, I gradually baled out the coracle with mysea-cap; then, getting my eye once more above the gunwale, I set myselfto study how it was she managed to slip so quietly through the rollers.I found each wave, instead of the big, smooth glossy mountain it looksfrom shore or from a vessel's deck, was for all the world like any rangeof hills on dry land, full of peaks and smooth places and valleys. Thecoracle, left to herself, turning from side to side, threaded, so tospeak, her way through these lower parts and avoided the steep slopesand higher, toppling summits of the wave."Well, now," thought I to myself, "it is plain I must lie where I am andnot disturb the balance; but it is plain also that I can put the paddleover the side and from time to time, in smooth places, give her a shoveor two towards land." No sooner thought upon than done. There I lay onmy elbows in the most trying attitude, and every now and again gave aweak stroke or two to turn her head to shore.It was very tiring and slow work, yet I did visibly gain ground; and aswe drew near the Cape of the Woods, though I saw I must infalliblymiss that point, I had still made some hundred yards of easting. I was,indeed, close in. I could see the cool green tree-tops swaying togetherin the breeze, and I felt sure I should make the next promontory withoutfail.It was high time, for I now began to be tortured with thirst. The glowof the sun from above, its thousandfold reflection from the waves, thesea-water that fell and dried upon me, caking my very lips with salt,combined to make my throat burn and my brain ache. The sight of thetrees so near at hand had almost made me sick with longing, but thecurrent had soon carried me past the point, and as the next reach of seaopened out, I beheld a sight that changed the nature of my thoughts.Right in front of me, not half a mile away, I beheld the HISPANIOLAunder sail. I made sure, of course, that I should be taken; but I wasso distressed for want of water that I scarce knew whether to be glador sorry at the thought, and long before I had come to a conclusion,surprise had taken entire possession of my mind and I could do nothingbut stare and wonder.The HISPANIOLA was under her main-sail and two jibs, and the beautifulwhite canvas shone in the sun like snow or silver. When I firstsighted her, all her sails were drawing; she was lying a course aboutnorth-west, and I presumed the men on board were going round the islandon their way back to the anchorage. Presently she began to fetch moreand more to the westward, so that I thought they had sighted me and weregoing about in chase. At last, however, she fell right into the wind'seye, was taken dead aback, and stood there awhile helpless, with hersails shivering."Clumsy fellows," said I; "they must still be drunk as owls." And Ithought how Captain Smollett would have set them skipping.Meanwhile the schooner gradually fell off and filled again upon anothertack, sailed swiftly for a minute or so, and brought up once more deadin the wind's eye. Again and again was this repeated. To and fro, up anddown, north, south, east, and west, the HISPANIOLA sailed by swoopsand dashes, and at each repetition ended as she had begun, with idlyflapping canvas. It became plain to me that nobody was steering. And ifso, where were the men? Either they were dead drunk or had deserted her,I thought, and perhaps if I could get on board I might return the vesselto her captain.The current was bearing coracle and schooner southward at an equal rate.As for the latter's sailing, it was so wild and intermittent, and shehung each time so long in irons, that she certainly gained nothing, ifshe did not even lose. If only I dared to sit up and paddle, I madesure that I could overhaul her. The scheme had an air of adventurethat inspired me, and the thought of the water breaker beside the forecompanion doubled my growing courage.Up I got, was welcomed almost instantly by another cloud of spray, butthis time stuck to my purpose and set myself, with all my strength andcaution, to paddle after the unsteered HISPANIOLA. Once I shipped a seaso heavy that I had to stop and bail, with my heart fluttering likea bird, but gradually I got into the way of the thing and guided mycoracle among the waves, with only now and then a blow upon her bows anda dash of foam in my face.I was now gaining rapidly on the schooner; I could see the brass glistenon the tiller as it banged about, and still no soul appeared upon herdecks. I could not choose but suppose she was deserted. If not, the menwere lying drunk below, where I might batten them down, perhaps, and dowhat I chose with the ship.For some time she had been doing the worse thing possible forme--standing still. She headed nearly due south, yawing, of course, allthe time. Each time she fell off, her sails partly filled, and thesebrought her in a moment right to the wind again. I have said this wasthe worst thing possible for me, for helpless as she looked in thissituation, with the canvas cracking like cannon and the blocks trundlingand banging on the deck, she still continued to run away from me, notonly with the speed of the current, but by the whole amount of herleeway, which was naturally great.But now, at last, I had my chance. The breeze fell for some seconds,very low, and the current gradually turning her, the HISPANIOLA revolvedslowly round her centre and at last presented me her stern, with thecabin window still gaping open and the lamp over the table still burningon into the day. The main-sail hung drooped like a banner. She wasstock-still but for the current.For the last little while I had even lost, but now redoubling myefforts, I began once more to overhaul the chase.I was not a hundred yards from her when the wind came again in a clap;she filled on the port tack and was off again, stooping and skimminglike a swallow.My first impulse was one of despair, but my second was towards joy.Round she came, till she was broadside on to me--round still till shehad covered a half and then two thirds and then three quarters of thedistance that separated us. I could see the waves boiling white underher forefoot. Immensely tall she looked to me from my low station in thecoracle.And then, of a sudden, I began to comprehend. I had scarce time tothink--scarce time to act and save myself. I was on the summit of oneswell when the schooner came stooping over the next. The bowsprit wasover my head. I sprang to my feet and leaped, stamping the coracle underwater. With one hand I caught the jib-boom, while my foot was lodgedbetween the stay and the brace; and as I still clung there panting, adull blow told me that the schooner had charged down upon and struck thecoracle and that I was left without retreat on the HISPANIOLA.25I Strike the Jolly RogerI HAD scarce gained a position on the bowsprit when the flying jibflapped and filled upon the other tack, with a report like a gun. Theschooner trembled to her keel under the reverse, but next moment, theother sails still drawing, the jib flapped back again and hung idle.This had nearly tossed me off into the sea; and now I lost no time,crawled back along the bowsprit, and tumbled head foremost on the deck.I was on the lee side of the forecastle, and the mainsail, which wasstill drawing, concealed from me a certain portion of the after-deck.Not a soul was to be seen. The planks, which had not been swabbed sincethe mutiny, bore the print of many feet, and an empty bottle, broken bythe neck, tumbled to and fro like a live thing in the scuppers.Suddenly the HISPANIOLA came right into the wind. The jibs behind mecracked aloud, the rudder slammed to, the whole ship gave a sickeningheave and shudder, and at the same moment the main-boom swung inboard,the sheet groaning in the blocks, and showed me the lee after-deck.There were the two watchmen, sure enough: red-cap on his back, as stiffas a handspike, with his arms stretched out like those of a crucifix andhis teeth showing through his open lips; Israel Hands propped againstthe bulwarks, his chin on his chest, his hands lying open before him onthe deck, his face as white, under its tan, as a tallow candle.For a while the ship kept bucking and sidling like a vicious horse, thesails filling, now on one tack, now on another, and the boom swinging toand fro till the mast groaned aloud under the strain. Now and again toothere would come a cloud of light sprays over the bulwark and a heavyblow of the ship's bows against the swell; so much heavier weather wasmade of it by this great rigged ship than by my home-made, lop-sidedcoracle, now gone to the bottom of the sea.At every jump of the schooner, red-cap slipped to and fro, but--what wasghastly to behold--neither his attitude nor his fixed teeth-disclosinggrin was anyway disturbed by this rough usage. At every jump too, Handsappeared still more to sink into himself and settle down upon thedeck, his feet sliding ever the farther out, and the whole body cantingtowards the stern, so that his face became, little by little, hidfrom me; and at last I could see nothing beyond his ear and the frayedringlet of one whisker.At the same time, I observed, around both of them, splashes of darkblood upon the planks and began to feel sure that they had killed eachother in their drunken wrath.While I was thus looking and wondering, in a calm moment, when the shipwas still, Israel Hands turned partly round and with a low moan writhedhimself back to the position in which I had seen him first. The moan,which told of pain and deadly weakness, and the way in which his jawhung open went right to my heart. But when I remembered the talk I hadoverheard from the apple barrel, all pity left me.I walked aft until I reached the main-mast."Come aboard, Mr. Hands," I said ironically.He rolled his eyes round heavily, but he was too far gone to expresssurprise. All he could do was to utter one word, "Brandy."It occurred to me there was no time to lose, and dodging the boom as itonce more lurched across the deck, I slipped aft and down the companionstairs into the cabin.It was such a scene of confusion as you can hardly fancy. All thelockfast places had been broken open in quest of the chart. The floorwas thick with mud where ruffians had sat down to drink or consult afterwading in the marshes round their camp. The bulkheads, all painted inclear white and beaded round with gilt, bore a pattern of dirty hands.Dozens of empty bottles clinked together in corners to the rolling ofthe ship. One of the doctor's medical books lay open on the table, halfof the leaves gutted out, I suppose, for pipelights. In the midst of allthis the lamp still cast a smoky glow, obscure and brown as umber.I went into the cellar; all the barrels were gone, and of the bottlesa most surprising number had been drunk out and thrown away. Certainly,since the mutiny began, not a man of them could ever have been sober.Foraging about, I found a bottle with some brandy left, for Hands; andfor myself I routed out some biscuit, some pickled fruits, a great bunchof raisins, and a piece of cheese. With these I came on deck, put downmy own stock behind the rudder head and well out of the coxswain'sreach, went forward to the water-breaker, and had a good deep drink ofwater, and then, and not till then, gave Hands the brandy.He must have drunk a gill before he took the bottle from his mouth."Aye," said he, "by thunder, but I wanted some o' that!"I had sat down already in my own corner and begun to eat."Much hurt?" I asked him.He grunted, or rather, I might say, he barked."If that doctor was aboard," he said, "I'd be right enough in a coupleof turns, but I don't have no manner of luck, you see, and that's what'sthe matter with me. As for that swab, he's good and dead, he is," headded, indicating the man with the red cap. "He warn't no seaman anyhow.And where mought you have come from?""Well," said I, "I've come aboard to take possession of this ship,Mr. Hands; and you'll please regard me as your captain until furthernotice."He looked at me sourly enough but said nothing. Some of the colour hadcome back into his cheeks, though he still looked very sick and stillcontinued to slip out and settle down as the ship banged about."By the by," I continued, "I can't have these colours, Mr. Hands; and byyour leave, I'll strike 'em. Better none than these."And again dodging the boom, I ran to the colour lines, handed down theircursed black flag, and chucked it overboard."God save the king!" said I, waving my cap. "And there's an end toCaptain Silver!"He watched me keenly and slyly, his chin all the while on his breast."I reckon," he said at last, "I reckon, Cap'n Hawkins, you'll kind ofwant to get ashore now. S'pose we talks.""Why, yes," says I, "with all my heart, Mr. Hands. Say on." And I wentback to my meal with a good appetite."This man," he began, nodding feebly at the corpse "--O'Brien were hisname, a rank Irelander--this man and me got the canvas on her, meaningfor to sail her back. Well, HE'S dead now, he is--as dead as bilge; andwho's to sail this ship, I don't see. Without I gives you a hint, youain't that man, as far's I can tell. Now, look here, you gives me foodand drink and a old scarf or ankecher to tie my wound up, you do, andI'll tell you how to sail her, and that's about square all round, I takeit.""I'll tell you one thing," says I: "I'm not going back to Captain Kidd'sanchorage. I mean to get into North Inlet and beach her quietly there.""To be sure you did," he cried. "Why, I ain't sich an infernal lubberafter all. I can see, can't I? I've tried my fling, I have, and I'velost, and it's you has the wind of me. North Inlet? Why, I haven't noch'ice, not I! I'd help you sail her up to Execution Dock, by thunder!So I would."Well, as it seemed to me, there was some sense in this. We struck ourbargain on the spot. In three minutes I had the HISPANIOLA sailingeasily before the wind along the coast of Treasure Island, with goodhopes of turning the northern point ere noon and beating down again asfar as North Inlet before high water, when we might beach her safely andwait till the subsiding tide permitted us to land.Then I lashed the tiller and went below to my own chest, where I got asoft silk handkerchief of my mother's. With this, and with my aid, Handsbound up the great bleeding stab he had received in the thigh, and afterhe had eaten a little and had a swallow or two more of the brandy, hebegan to pick up visibly, sat straighter up, spoke louder and clearer,and looked in every way another man.The breeze served us admirably. We skimmed before it like a bird, thecoast of the island flashing by and the view changing every minute.Soon we were past the high lands and bowling beside low, sandy country,sparsely dotted with dwarf pines, and soon we were beyond that againand had turned the corner of the rocky hill that ends the island on thenorth.I was greatly elated with my new command, and pleased with the bright,sunshiny weather and these different prospects of the coast. I had nowplenty of water and good things to eat, and my conscience, which hadsmitten me hard for my desertion, was quieted by the great conquest Ihad made. I should, I think, have had nothing left me to desire but forthe eyes of the coxswain as they followed me derisively about the deckand the odd smile that appeared continually on his face. It was a smilethat had in it something both of pain and weakness--a haggard old man'ssmile; but there was, besides that, a grain of derision, a shadow oftreachery, in his expression as he craftily watched, and watched, andwatched me at my work.26Israel HandsTHE wind, serving us to a desire, now hauled into the west. We could runso much the easier from the north-east corner of the island to the mouthof the North Inlet. Only, as we had no power to anchor and dared notbeach her till the tide had flowed a good deal farther, time hung on ourhands. The coxswain told me how to lay the ship to; after a good manytrials I succeeded, and we both sat in silence over another meal."Cap'n," said he at length with that same uncomfortable smile, "here'smy old shipmate, O'Brien; s'pose you was to heave him overboard. I ain'tpartic'lar as a rule, and I don't take no blame for settling his hash,but I don't reckon him ornamental now, do you?""I'm not strong enough, and I don't like the job; and there he lies, forme," said I."This here's an unlucky ship, this HISPANIOLA, Jim," he went on,blinking. "There's a power of men been killed in this HISPANIOLA--asight o' poor seamen dead and gone since you and me took ship toBristol. I never seen sich dirty luck, not I. There was this hereO'Brien now--he's dead, ain't he? Well now, I'm no scholar, and you're alad as can read and figure, and to put it straight, do you take it as adead man is dead for good, or do he come alive again?""You can kill the body, Mr. Hands, but not the spirit; you must knowthat already," I replied. "O'Brien there is in another world, and may bewatching us.""Ah!" says he. "Well, that's unfort'nate--appears as if killing partieswas a waste of time. Howsomever, sperrits don't reckon for much, by whatI've seen. I'll chance it with the sperrits, Jim. And now, you've spokeup free, and I'll take it kind if you'd step down into that there cabinand get me a--well, a--shiver my timbers! I can't hit the name on 't;well, you get me a bottle of wine, Jim--this here brandy's too strongfor my head."Now, the coxswain's hesitation seemed to be unnatural, and as for thenotion of his preferring wine to brandy, I entirely disbelieved it. Thewhole story was a pretext. He wanted me to leave the deck--so much wasplain; but with what purpose I could in no way imagine. His eyes nevermet mine; they kept wandering to and fro, up and down, now with a lookto the sky, now with a flitting glance upon the dead O'Brien. All thetime he kept smiling and putting his tongue out in the most guilty,embarrassed manner, so that a child could have told that he was bent onsome deception. I was prompt with my answer, however, for I saw wheremy advantage lay and that with a fellow so densely stupid I could easilyconceal my suspicions to the end."Some wine?" I said. "Far better. Will you have white or red?""Well, I reckon it's about the blessed same to me, shipmate," hereplied; "so it's strong, and plenty of it, what's the odds?""All right," I answered. "I'll bring you port, Mr. Hands. But I'll haveto dig for it."With that I scuttled down the companion with all the noise I could,slipped off my shoes, ran quietly along the sparred gallery, mounted theforecastle ladder, and popped my head out of the fore companion. Iknew he would not expect to see me there, yet I took every precautionpossible, and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved too true.He had risen from his position to his hands and knees, and though hisleg obviously hurt him pretty sharply when he moved--for I could hearhim stifle a groan--yet it was at a good, rattling rate that he trailedhimself across the deck. In half a minute he had reached the portscuppers and picked, out of a coil of rope, a long knife, or rather ashort dirk, discoloured to the hilt with blood. He looked upon it fora moment, thrusting forth his under jaw, tried the point upon his hand,and then, hastily concealing it in the bosom of his jacket, trundledback again into his old place against the bulwark.This was all that I required to know. Israel could move about, he wasnow armed, and if he had been at so much trouble to get rid of me,it was plain that I was meant to be the victim. What he would doafterwards--whether he would try to crawl right across the island fromNorth Inlet to the camp among the swamps or whether he would fire LongTom, trusting that his own comrades might come first to help him--was,of course, more than I could say.Yet I felt sure that I could trust him in one point, since in thatour interests jumped together, and that was in the disposition ofthe schooner. We both desired to have her stranded safe enough, in asheltered place, and so that, when the time came, she could be got offagain with as little labour and danger as might be; and until that wasdone I considered that my life would certainly be spared.While I was thus turning the business over in my mind, I had not beenidle with my body. I had stolen back to the cabin, slipped once moreinto my shoes, and laid my hand at random on a bottle of wine, and now,with this for an excuse, I made my reappearance on the deck.Hands lay as I had left him, all fallen together in a bundle and withhis eyelids lowered as though he were too weak to bear the light. Helooked up, however, at my coming, knocked the neck off the bottle likea man who had done the same thing often, and took a good swig, with hisfavourite toast of "Here's luck!" Then he lay quiet for a little, andthen, pulling out a stick of tobacco, begged me to cut him a quid."Cut me a junk o' that," says he, "for I haven't no knife and hardlystrength enough, so be as I had. Ah, Jim, Jim, I reckon I've missedstays! Cut me a quid, as'll likely be the last, lad, for I'm for my longhome, and no mistake.""Well," said I, "I'll cut you some tobacco, but if I was you and thoughtmyself so badly, I would go to my prayers like a Christian man.""Why?" said he. "Now, you tell me why.""Why?" I cried. "You were asking me just now about the dead. You'vebroken your trust; you've lived in sin and lies and blood; there's a manyou killed lying at your feet this moment, and you ask me why! For God'smercy, Mr. Hands, that's why."I spoke with a little heat, thinking of the bloody dirk he had hiddenin his pocket and designed, in his ill thoughts, to end me with. He,for his part, took a great draught of the wine and spoke with the mostunusual solemnity."For thirty years," he said, "I've sailed the seas and seen good andbad, better and worse, fair weather and foul, provisions running out,knives going, and what not. Well, now I tell you, I never seen good comeo' goodness yet. Him as strikes first is my fancy; dead men don't bite;them's my views--amen, so be it. And now, you look here," he added,suddenly changing his tone, "we've had about enough of this foolery. Thetide's made good enough by now. You just take my orders, Cap'n Hawkins,and we'll sail slap in and be done with it."All told, we had scarce two miles to run; but the navigation wasdelicate, the entrance to this northern anchorage was not only narrowand shoal, but lay east and west, so that the schooner must be nicelyhandled to be got in. I think I was a good, prompt subaltern, and I amvery sure that Hands was an excellent pilot, for we went about and aboutand dodged in, shaving the banks, with a certainty and a neatness thatwere a pleasure to behold.Scarcely had we passed the heads before the land closed around us. Theshores of North Inlet were as thickly wooded as those of the southernanchorage, but the space was longer and narrower and more like, what intruth it was, the estuary of a river. Right before us, at the southernend, we saw the wreck of a ship in the last stages of dilapidation. Ithad been a great vessel of three masts but had lain so long exposed tothe injuries of the weather that it was hung about with great webs ofdripping seaweed, and on the deck of it shore bushes had taken root andnow flourished thick with flowers. It was a sad sight, but it showed usthat the anchorage was calm."Now," said Hands, "look there; there's a pet bit for to beach a shipin. Fine flat sand, never a cat's paw, trees all around of it, andflowers a-blowing like a garding on that old ship.""And once beached," I inquired, "how shall we get her off again?""Why, so," he replied: "you take a line ashore there on the other sideat low water, take a turn about one of them big pines; bring it back,take a turn around the capstan, and lie to for the tide. Come highwater, all hands take a pull upon the line, and off she comes as sweetas natur'. And now, boy, you stand by. We're near the bit now, and she'stoo much way on her. Starboard a little--so--steady--starboard--larboarda little--steady--steady!"So he issued his commands, which I breathlessly obeyed, till, all of asudden, he cried, "Now, my hearty, luff!" And I put the helm hard up,and the HISPANIOLA swung round rapidly and ran stem on for the low,wooded shore.The excitement of these last manoeuvres had somewhat interfered with thewatch I had kept hitherto, sharply enough, upon the coxswain. Even thenI was still so much interested, waiting for the ship to touch, that Ihad quite forgot the peril that hung over my head and stood craning overthe starboard bulwarks and watching the ripples spreading wide beforethe bows. I might have fallen without a struggle for my life had not asudden disquietude seized upon me and made me turn my head. Perhaps Ihad heard a creak or seen his shadow moving with the tail of my eye;perhaps it was an instinct like a cat's; but, sure enough, when I lookedround, there was Hands, already half-way towards me, with the dirk inhis right hand.We must both have cried out aloud when our eyes met, but while minewas the shrill cry of terror, his was a roar of fury like a chargingbully's. At the same instant, he threw himself forward and I leaptsideways towards the bows. As I did so, I let go of the tiller, whichsprang sharp to leeward, and I think this saved my life, for it struckHands across the chest and stopped him, for the moment, dead.Before he could recover, I was safe out of the corner where he had metrapped, with all the deck to dodge about. Just forward of the main-mastI stopped, drew a pistol from my pocket, took a cool aim, though he hadalready turned and was once more coming directly after me, and drew thetrigger. The hammer fell, but there followed neither flash nor sound;the priming was useless with sea-water. I cursed myself for my neglect.Why had not I, long before, reprimed and reloaded my only weapons? ThenI should not have been as now, a mere fleeing sheep before this butcher.Wounded as he was, it was wonderful how fast he could move, his grizzledhair tumbling over his face, and his face itself as red as a red ensignwith his haste and fury. I had no time to try my other pistol, norindeed much inclination, for I was sure it would be useless. One thing Isaw plainly: I must not simply retreat before him, or he would speedilyhold me boxed into the bows, as a moment since he had so nearly boxedme in the stern. Once so caught, and nine or ten inches of theblood-stained dirk would be my last experience on this side of eternity.I placed my palms against the main-mast, which was of a goodish bigness,and waited, every nerve upon the stretch.Seeing that I meant to dodge, he also paused; and a moment or two passedin feints on his part and corresponding movements upon mine. It was sucha game as I had often played at home about the rocks of Black Hill Cove,but never before, you may be sure, with such a wildly beating heart asnow. Still, as I say, it was a boy's game, and I thought I could holdmy own at it against an elderly seaman with a wounded thigh. Indeed mycourage had begun to rise so high that I allowed myself a few dartingthoughts on what would be the end of the affair, and while I sawcertainly that I could spin it out for long, I saw no hope of anyultimate escape.Well, while things stood thus, suddenly the HISPANIOLA struck,staggered, ground for an instant in the sand, and then, swift as ablow, canted over to the port side till the deck stood at an angleof forty-five degrees and about a puncheon of water splashed into thescupper holes and lay, in a pool, between the deck and bulwark.We were both of us capsized in a second, and both of us rolled, almosttogether, into the scuppers, the dead red-cap, with his arms stillspread out, tumbling stiffly after us. So near were we, indeed, that myhead came against the coxswain's foot with a crack that made my teethrattle. Blow and all, I was the first afoot again, for Hands had gotinvolved with the dead body. The sudden canting of the ship had made thedeck no place for running on; I had to find some new way of escape,and that upon the instant, for my foe was almost touching me. Quick asthought, I sprang into the mizzen shrouds, rattled up hand over hand,and did not draw a breath till I was seated on the cross-trees.I had been saved by being prompt; the dirk had struck not half a footbelow me as I pursued my upward flight; and there stood Israel Handswith his mouth open and his face upturned to mine, a perfect statue ofsurprise and disappointment.Now that I had a moment to myself, I lost no time in changing thepriming of my pistol, and then, having one ready for service, and tomake assurance doubly sure, I proceeded to draw the load of the otherand recharge it afresh from the beginning.My new employment struck Hands all of a heap; he began to see the dicegoing against him, and after an obvious hesitation, he also hauledhimself heavily into the shrouds, and with the dirk in his teeth, beganslowly and painfully to mount. It cost him no end of time and groansto haul his wounded leg behind him, and I had quietly finished myarrangements before he was much more than a third of the way up. Then,with a pistol in either hand, I addressed him."One more step, Mr. Hands," said I, "and I'll blow your brains out! Deadmen don't bite, you know," I added with a chuckle.He stopped instantly. I could see by the working of his face that he wastrying to think, and the process was so slow and laborious that, in mynew-found security, I laughed aloud. At last, with a swallow or two, hespoke, his face still wearing the same expression of extreme perplexity.In order to speak he had to take the dagger from his mouth, but in allelse he remained unmoved."Jim," says he, "I reckon we're fouled, you and me, and we'll have tosign articles. I'd have had you but for that there lurch, but I don'thave no luck, not I; and I reckon I'll have to strike, which comes hard,you see, for a master mariner to a ship's younker like you, Jim."I was drinking in his words and smiling away, as conceited as a cockupon a wall, when, all in a breath, back went his right hand over hisshoulder. Something sang like an arrow through the air; I felt a blowand then a sharp pang, and there I was pinned by the shoulder to themast. In the horrid pain and surprise of the moment--I scarce can sayit was by my own volition, and I am sure it was without a consciousaim--both my pistols went off, and both escaped out of my hands. Theydid not fall alone; with a choked cry, the coxswain loosed his graspupon the shrouds and plunged head first into the water.27"Pieces of Eight"OWING to the cant of the vessel, the masts hung far out over the water,and from my perch on the cross-trees I had nothing below me but thesurface of the bay. Hands, who was not so far up, was in consequencenearer to the ship and fell between me and the bulwarks. He rose once tothe surface in a lather of foam and blood and then sank again for good.As the water settled, I could see him lying huddled together on theclean, bright sand in the shadow of the vessel's sides. A fish or twowhipped past his body. Sometimes, by the quivering of the water, heappeared to move a little, as if he were trying to rise. But he was deadenough, for all that, being both shot and drowned, and was food for fishin the very place where he had designed my slaughter.I was no sooner certain of this than I began to feel sick, faint, andterrified. The hot blood was running over my back and chest. The dirk,where it had pinned my shoulder to the mast, seemed to burn like a hotiron; yet it was not so much these real sufferings that distressed me,for these, it seemed to me, I could bear without a murmur; it was thehorror I had upon my mind of falling from the cross-trees into thatstill green water, beside the body of the coxswain.I clung with both hands till my nails ached, and I shut my eyes as if tocover up the peril. Gradually my mind came back again, my pulses quieteddown to a more natural time, and I was once more in possession ofmyself.It was my first thought to pluck forth the dirk, but either it stuck toohard or my nerve failed me, and I desisted with a violent shudder. Oddlyenough, that very shudder did the business. The knife, in fact, had comethe nearest in the world to missing me altogether; it held me by a merepinch of skin, and this the shudder tore away. The blood ran down thefaster, to be sure, but I was my own master again and only tacked to themast by my coat and shirt.These last I broke through with a sudden jerk, and then regained thedeck by the starboard shrouds. For nothing in the world would I haveagain ventured, shaken as I was, upon the overhanging port shrouds fromwhich Israel had so lately fallen.I went below and did what I could for my wound; it pained me a good dealand still bled freely, but it was neither deep nor dangerous, nor did itgreatly gall me when I used my arm. Then I looked around me, and as theship was now, in a sense, my own, I began to think of clearing it fromits last passenger--the dead man, O'Brien.He had pitched, as I have said, against the bulwarks, where he laylike some horrible, ungainly sort of puppet, life-size, indeed, but howdifferent from life's colour or life's comeliness! In that positionI could easily have my way with him, and as the habit of tragicaladventures had worn off almost all my terror for the dead, I took himby the waist as if he had been a sack of bran and with one good heave,tumbled him overboard. He went in with a sounding plunge; the red capcame off and remained floating on the surface; and as soon as the splashsubsided, I could see him and Israel lying side by side, both waveringwith the tremulous movement of the water. O'Brien, though still quite ayoung man, was very bald. There he lay, with that bald head across theknees of the man who had killed him and the quick fishes steering to andfro over both.I was now alone upon the ship; the tide had just turned. The sun waswithin so few degrees of setting that already the shadow of the pinesupon the western shore began to reach right across the anchorage andfall in patterns on the deck. The evening breeze had sprung up, andthough it was well warded off by the hill with the two peaks upon theeast, the cordage had begun to sing a little softly to itself and theidle sails to rattle to and fro.I began to see a danger to the ship. The jibs I speedily doused andbrought tumbling to the deck, but the main-sail was a harder matter. Ofcourse, when the schooner canted over, the boom had swung out-board, andthe cap of it and a foot or two of sail hung even under water. I thoughtthis made it still more dangerous; yet the strain was so heavy that Ihalf feared to meddle. At last I got my knife and cut the halyards. Thepeak dropped instantly, a great belly of loose canvas floated broad uponthe water, and since, pull as I liked, I could not budge the downhall,that was the extent of what I could accomplish. For the rest, theHISPANIOLA must trust to luck, like myself.By this time the whole anchorage had fallen into shadow--the last rays,I remember, falling through a glade of the wood and shining bright asjewels on the flowery mantle of the wreck. It began to be chill; thetide was rapidly fleeting seaward, the schooner settling more and moreon her beam-ends.I scrambled forward and looked over. It seemed shallow enough, andholding the cut hawser in both hands for a last security, I let myselfdrop softly overboard. The water scarcely reached my waist; the sand wasfirm and covered with ripple marks, and I waded ashore in great spirits,leaving the HISPANIOLA on her side, with her main-sail trailing wideupon the surface of the bay. About the same time, the sun went fairlydown and the breeze whistled low in the dusk among the tossing pines.At least, and at last, I was off the sea, nor had I returned thenceempty-handed. There lay the schooner, clear at last from buccaneersand ready for our own men to board and get to sea again. I had nothingnearer my fancy than to get home to the stockade and boast of myachievements. Possibly I might be blamed a bit for my truantry, but therecapture of the HISPANIOLA was a clenching answer, and I hoped thateven Captain Smollett would confess I had not lost my time.So thinking, and in famous spirits, I began to set my face homeward forthe block house and my companions. I remembered that the most easterlyof the rivers which drain into Captain Kidd's anchorage ran from thetwo-peaked hill upon my left, and I bent my course in that directionthat I might pass the stream while it was small. The wood was prettyopen, and keeping along the lower spurs, I had soon turned the cornerof that hill, and not long after waded to the mid-calf across thewatercourse.This brought me near to where I had encountered Ben Gunn, the maroon;and I walked more circumspectly, keeping an eye on every side. The duskhad come nigh hand completely, and as I opened out the cleft between thetwo peaks, I became aware of a wavering glow against the sky, where, asI judged, the man of the island was cooking his supper before a roaringfire. And yet I wondered, in my heart, that he should show himself socareless. For if I could see this radiance, might it not reach the eyesof Silver himself where he camped upon the shore among the marshes?Gradually the night fell blacker; it was all I could do to guide myselfeven roughly towards my destination; the double hill behind me and theSpy-glass on my right hand loomed faint and fainter; the stars were fewand pale; and in the low ground where I wandered I kept tripping amongbushes and rolling into sandy pits.Suddenly a kind of brightness fell about me. I looked up; a pale glimmerof moonbeams had alighted on the summit of the Spy-glass, and soon afterI saw something broad and silvery moving low down behind the trees, andknew the moon had risen.With this to help me, I passed rapidly over what remained to me of myjourney, and sometimes walking, sometimes running, impatiently drew nearto the stockade. Yet, as I began to thread the grove that lies beforeit, I was not so thoughtless but that I slacked my pace and went atrifle warily. It would have been a poor end of my adventures to getshot down by my own party in mistake.
