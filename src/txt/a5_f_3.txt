HID kit installation is very popular and it is one of the common upgrades for increasing the stock headlight assembly's brightness.

Your headlights and fog lights give very bright light even from the existing headlights and fog lights.


The HID headlight kits available from some online stores come in various colors and wattage. You can get high intensity as well as common low wattage products from some good providers.

Look for HID kit with the following color combinations - 6000K for WHITE HID color, 3000K for YELLOW HID color and 8000K for BLUE HID color. In this, K stands for Kelvins, the standard industry measurement of color for HID light color output.


Some other color options available are Low wattage 3000K and 6000 K for HID headlights and HID fog lights. You should ensure that if the TD HID kit offered is an HID conversion kit, you do not try to fit it into the factory headlights that come with pre-installed factory HID lights.

During the hotter months of the year, especially with the high price of fuel, many motorcycles are found on the highways. All drivers need to follow a preventive driving style if we are to succeed in curbing motorcycling accidents, now that the number of motorcycle riders is so much greater. There are a variety of methods in which you can help to keep the number of accidents down.

If you're operating a motorcycle, you need to be responsible, by wearing the proper safety equipment, and not exceeding the speed limit for the conditions. Avoid riding in busy traffic and on freeways unless of course you are a skilled rider. Not only will that place you vulnerable to an accident, but others in the process. Before you go for a ride, be sure that all parts of the bike are working well, and pay special attention to the controls. For neither an automobile nor a motorcycle can it be acceptable to be driving intoxicated. Quite a few bike accidents appear to involve consumption of alcohol.

Keeping an attentive eye on other road-users is crucial for a biker. Motor vehicles have blind spots where the driver cannot see other vehicles, and it's worse with bikes. Motorcycle riders have to be completely ready always, for a car to swerve into the other lane, not knowing that you are even there. Night-time driving, of course, requires that along with everything else, your headlights should be in good working order. Without having much experience, your risk of having an mishap is greater. Novice riders have less awareness of the regulations of the road, and are a lot less relaxed when operating their motorcycle. Of course, older riders might also wind up in accidents if they get careless about being attentive at all times.

A bike rider must be more cautious with obstructions in the road. A vehicle can hit an obstruction like a loose board lying in the road and get away with it, but for a biker that can mean death. Anybody who drives a car has to be vigilant about monitoring all other vehicles, and watch out for them - bikes in particular - getting lost in blind spots. Prior to making any changes always display your intention utilizing your signal lights, and look in the mirrors a few times, not just once. Older design motorcycles do not have turn signals, so hold a close watch for any turns. At night you need to pay attention, because that specific light heading towards you might be a motorcycle, or a car with a headlight out.

It is best to follow a motorcycle ahead of you by an extended distance than you would a car. Any sudden stopping that causes a rear end crash will be a lot worse when you rear end a motorcycle. Damages will be much more extreme than when you rear end someone in a car. Crashes are invariably unexpected, and can happen to any individual, even very experienced riders. You cannot take away every hazard, but you can be aware, by driving defensively.

With wood shutters, wood blinds are the choice of a consumer who is hunting for basic, warm and all-natural selections for window coverings.

So, what can you do if you want the search and feel of real wooden, but the value stops you just before you can make a good determination? You've guessed it - search into much more cost-effective fake wooden blinds.

In a quick time period of time, faux wood blinds have created some severe competition for the traditional wood blinds "in the raw".
"Faux" wooden means "imitation" wooden.

Different manufacturers contact the same fake (imitation) wood blinds by diverse names like ... Everwoods ®, NuWoods ® or Woodmates ®. Irrespective of the title, the slats and bottom rails on these blinds are made of vinyl on your own, or composite supplies, which are wood and vinyl.

The use of vinyl in these goods, be it a part or a hundred%, helps make them moisture-resistant, much more durable and they expense much much less to generate. The benefits can aid you whilst choosing which blinds to get. 1st, the value is far better. 2nd, you can use fake wooden blinds in the locations of higher humidity and traffic (exactly where real wood blinds would experience with visible damages on them).

Depending on whom you talk to, you'll hear different things about email marketing. Some marketers will state that it's completely unnecessary, and will distract you against what's most important. Other marketers will state that it's the best thing you can do, so jump on it at this time!

Even though there is some merit to every side, typically you can't go wrong with learning this form of marketing. If you're able to build an email list of interested people inside your niche, you have almost instant traffic to any type of offer you want.

The actual trick about e-mail marketing is finding out how to get the most out of this traffic!

For example, there are some marketers who can make 6 figures a year with a small listing of roughly 1,000 people. If you feel about it measuring only $100 from each individual on their list, which could definitely happen if you have great relationships with those people. On the other hand, you may have a list of 10,000 people and not make that kind of money in a year! That's because with a horrible job of creating relationships, people won't are interested your product.

The thing is just like any other type of business, marketing is all about trust. You need customers that trust what you're doing and the products you're promoting. Should you aren't able to reveal that you have some quality stuff to say or sell, then you definitely won't make much cash. Another thing about email marketing that many individuals don't realize may be the importance of testing something totally new. The world revolves around innovation, many times it is the state-of-the-art company that wins a war.

Internet marketing, whether with emails or other forms of traffic, may be the exact same way!

One example of something you need to test is different email subject lines. Should you send an email to your listing of 1,000 people also it only has one subject line, you cannot compare it to anything.

Instead, it's better to do a test and send one subject line to 500 people and a different someone to another 500 people. This will allow you to see a difference in open rates, and you can decide which title worked much better.

This is a simple thing to understand about e-mail marketing but if you truly embrace and practice it, you'll make a LOT more money!

Something else to consider is applying an autoresponder versus broadcasting emails. The benefit of using an autoresponder is that once it's set up, you don't have to do anything whatsoever else! All you have to do is drive traffic to your website so people subscribe to your list.

If you are doing broadcasts, you need to keep writing new emails to transmit to your list. The benefit is that if they are being used correctly you will likely have a more responsive list.

The trick with this particular is to simply test. You can definitely find that some niches such as the internet marketing niche could be more responsive to broadcasts, but others for example weight loss may be fine by having an autoresponder.

While, the concept of painting your own rims has been around a few years now, many questions pop up of how to do it and I thought I would share my own experiences with painting my Integra stock rims. I have read up many examples of how to do this, but my first time trying was this year when I chose to refinish my winter rims. I was quite please with the outcome.

First, what the hell do you need to paint your rims? Paint of course :) This is where Duplicolor comes in with their wheel paint. They offer paint colors to match your style coming in white, gunmetal, classic silver and bronze as well. I chose to do mine in gunmetal leaving my lip the stock polished style look. So here are your options:

So you chose your color, bought your paint and are semi-ready. First, you need to sand down your rims. Why? This gives the surface a rough texture so the paint has something to adhere to. Reference the article to polish your rims on how sanding of the rims works. The only difference with this is how far you want to go. In my case, being winter rims painted I chose not to go through the process of stripping the paint on the rims completely. I simply sanded down the surface with 300 grit sandpaper ensuring to make everything sanded equally. This gives the rough surface required for the paint to adhere, and as long as your rims had no damage it should be good enough. 
our rims are sanded; you have your paint and now are ready. First, make sure you clean all sanding dust off the rims and ensure a totally clean surface so the paint will stick and not flake off after your first drive out with your newly painted rims!!! Here are my rims washed and ready to completely dry before painting:

My rims are masked off with newspaper and masking tape. Of course you want to do this so you don't turn your tires into the color you are painting. I don't want gunmetal painted tires. Also if you look close enough, you will know that the lip has been masked off as well. So I carefully applied the masking tape on the lip to protect it from being painted as well. Also, you know the little thing you pump your air into, mask that off as well unless you want that to have a color change as well :)

The rims are dry, you have masked off what you don't want painted and now you are ready. Put some newspaper on the ground and place the rim on top of the newspaper. You don't want to paint the concrete underneath the rim so keep it clean with the newspaper.

Now apply your first coat of paint. Let the paint dry well and next day admire your handiwork and results.

Although a motorcycle battery and other types of vehicle batteries are built for longevity, over time batteries will slow down and eventually wear out. This occurs when the sulfate that flows over the plates begins to build up a residue on the plates, slowly diminishing the conductivity. In this article you'll find useful information for choosing, installing, and maintaining your next motorcycle battery.

Choosing the correct size:
In order to choose the right size motorcycle battery, you'll need to know the cold cranking amps (CCA) of your bike. Technically speaking, CCA is the number of amps a lead-acid battery at 0ºF can deliver for 30 seconds and maintain at least 1.2 volts per cell. Once you determine the required CCA, you'll need to measure the length, width, and height of the cavity to ensure a correct fit.

Removal and installation basics:
When the time comes to replace your motorcycle battery, never remove the battery while the engine is running. If for reason it does not have a charge, always remove the negative cable before the positive. When installing the new battery, reverse the order and connect the positive cable first before connecting the negative. Take extra caution to identify the positive and negative terminals before attaching the cables. Accidentally reversing the polarity can cause the battery to explode or inflict a great deal of damage to your bike's electrical system.
Recharging:
If the battery won't start or seems dull, you may only need to recharge it. Always check the voltage of your motorcycle battery before recharging and never charge your battery at an amperage more than 1/6 the rated capacity of your battery. For example, it you have a 7 amp-hour battery, you should not charge it at an amperage of more than 1 amps. If you have an 18 amp-hour battery, you can charge it at a maximum of 3 amps. Therefore, most battery tenders offer charging amperage of from 1/2 amp up to 2 amps. NOTE: NEVER USE AN AUTOMOBILE BATTERY CHARGER ON YOUR POWERSPORT SEALED BATTERY. Although recharging seems like a simple process, as a general rule of thumb always wear protective eye wear and refrain from smoking as you are working with explosive gasses.
While, the concept of painting your own rims has been around a few years now, many questions pop up of how to do it and I thought I would share my own experiences with painting my Integra stock rims. I have read up many examples of how to do this, but my first time trying was this year when I chose to refinish my winter rims. I was quite please with the outcome.

First, what the hell do you need to paint your rims? Paint of course :) This is where Duplicolor comes in with their wheel paint. They offer paint colors to match your style coming in white, gunmetal, classic silver and bronze as well. I chose to do mine in gunmetal leaving my lip the stock polished style look. So here are your options:

So you chose your color, bought your paint and are semi-ready. First, you need to sand down your rims. Why? This gives the surface a rough texture so the paint has something to adhere to. Reference the article to polish your rims on how sanding of the rims works. The only difference with this is how far you want to go. In my case, being winter rims painted I chose not to go through the process of stripping the paint on the rims completely. I simply sanded down the surface with 300 grit sandpaper ensuring to make everything sanded equally. This gives the rough surface required for the paint to adhere, and as long as your rims had no damage it should be good enough.

Your rims are sanded; you have your paint and now are ready. First, make sure you clean all sanding dust off the rims and ensure a totally clean surface so the paint will stick and not flake off after your first drive out with your newly painted rims!!! Here are my rims washed and ready to completely dry before painting:

My rims are masked off with newspaper and masking tape. Of course you want to do this so you don't turn your tires into the color you are painting. I don't want gunmetal painted tires. Also if you look close enough, you will know that the lip has been masked off as well. So I carefully applied the masking tape on the lip to protect it from being painted as well. Also, you know the little thing you pump your air into, mask that off as well unless you want that to have a color change as well 

The rims are dry, you have masked off what you don't want painted and now you are ready. Put some newspaper on the ground and place the rim on top of the newspaper. You don't want to paint the concrete underneath the rim so keep it clean with the newspaper.
How Is the Blue Book Value Calculated?

The RV blue book value takes a lot of different conditions into consideration. First, it will consider the average price asked by dealers for that specific make, model, and year.

Depending on which blue book you choose to use, you may be provided various values, such as retail, private party, and trade-in. The retail price will include profit, advertisement, commission, and other amounts that may be associated with doing business. Typically, retail value is used for selling the RV to a dealer.

Private party will give the value that someone might consider when selling to another person that is not a professional dealer. This value assumes that the RV is in top condition and meets all standards that it originally came with. Of course, there are many things to be considered when determining your selling price.

An automatic transmission is just that- automatic, consequently most people tend to pay very little attention to it until a major problem rears its ugly head.

Picture the scenario- you are driving along in the lap of luxury, the satellite radio blaring and the heated seats on. You have become accustomed to the comfort level and great driving experience brought to you by BMW.

You decide to stop at the local convenience store on your way home to grab some ice cream for the kids and a bottle of water for yourself. Upon returning to your car, you start it up, check your rear view mirror, put the shifter in reverse and then the unthinkable happens- the engine just revs as if it is in neutral and the car goes nowhere!

This article deals with the reasons behind an unexpected loss of reverse in certain BMW automatic transmission equipped vehicles, specifically the 3 series and 5 series vehicles that use the ZF5HP19 or steptronic transmission. This includes the popular 323i, 323ci, 325i, 328i, 330i, 525i, 528i, 530i, X3 and X5 models well as some others built in the 1999 to present model years.

To eliminate confusion, this does not apply to vehicles equipped with the GM 5L40 E transmission, just the ones with the sometimes problematic ZF5HP19. The 5L40 E has some issues of its own that are beyond the scope of this article but are certainly going to be the subject of another.

The failure rate for these transmissions seems to be very high and is expected to become much more of a problem as time goes by.

Typically, the vehicle is working perfectly while driving forward but when it is put in reverse there is a complete and permanent loss of movement to back up.

Reverse is typically a major feat for any transmission to accomplish- imagine the demands that are placed on a gearbox as it is asked to reverse the torque of your engine so that you can back up your nearly 4000 pound vehicle.

By far, the most common cause of the reverse problem in BMW's is the failure of the D-G clutch drum. Specifically, the snap ring that retains the D or reverse clutch breaks out of the clutch drum resulting in an inability for the clutch pack to apply.

The good news is that there is hope in regards to a proper repair. The factory has released an updated part that so far appears to be a permanent fix for this problem.

In our testing and in conjunction with several hundred successful repairs at our facilities, the new part seems to be metallurgically superior in several ways.

We have found that there is an improved radius area as well as slightly thicker casting. In addition to this, the grove that retains the snap ring is also relocated further away from the edge of the drum.

With this issue addressed and attention to detail in several other areas of the ZF5HP19 unit, the transmission can be repaired to "better than new" condition by a competent transmission rebuilder / remanufacturer. In fact, when properly repaired, the ZF gearbox becomes quite robust and can provide an almost indefinite service life.

ybrid cars are considered as the car of the future. It is able to effectively conserve fuel and at the same time, it only produces low levels of toxic fumes. Because of these benefits, hybrid cars are now growing in popularity every single day. Many people are now considering getting rid of their conventional cars and purchase a hybrid car to help in cutting fuel consumption cost.

Hybrid cars have two engines for it to effectively conserve fuel consumption. It has the traditional gasoline engine and it also has an electric motor and batteries. The two engines work together in order to cut fuel consumption. With this technology, you will be able to cut fuel usage by more than half. Just imagine, with a hybrid car, you will be able to go more than 60 miles to the gallon. With this kind of savings, hybrid cars are definitely the car of the future.

Hybrid car owners virtually do not feel the increasing cost in fuel prices. This is the main advantage of the hybrid car. There are other advantages that a hybrid car can give you. Recently, the President of the United States has signed an agreement that hybrid car buyers will be able to enjoy tax incentives. This means that by owning a hybrid car, you will be able to save money on taxes.
There are other benefits that the government imposes on hybrid car owners, such as free parking, and free entry to car pool lanes. Some even offer discounted fees on toll gates.

The braking in hybrid cars is also configured to capture the energy released and uses it to charge the batteries inside the hybrid car. This means that unlike electric cars, hybrid cars do not actually need to be charged from your home electric outlet.

However, with all the advantages that a hybrid car can give you, there are also disadvantages. The main disadvantage of hybrid cars is that the retail price is quite expensive. Only people who have enough money can purchase hybrid cars. However, the twist in all this is that hybrid cars are actually cheaper when compared to conventional cars in the long run. If you compute the total fuel consumption of both cars, you will actually see that you can save a lot more money on hybrid cars.

The only thing is that hybrid cars are expensive right from the car lot.

Hybrid cars are relatively heavy because of the heavy batteries installed inside the car. This is why hybrid car manufacturers integrates smaller internal combustion engines and are constructed with light materials and should be aerodynamic in order to maximize efficiency. This means that hybrid cars can never really go fast.

Another issue about hybrid cars is that it is very risky in accidents. What makes a hybrid car work effectively is also what makes it risky if it ever gets involved in an accident. This is because hybrid cars stores high amount of voltage in its batteries. This means that there is a high chance of getting electrocuted when you get involved in an accident. This also means that it is relatively difficult for rescuers to get the drivers and passengers out of the hybrid cars because of the dangers of high voltage in the car.

These are the advantages and the disadvantages of hybrid cars. Car manufacturers today are now looking for ways to get rid of the disadvantages of hybrid cars. In the near future, you will see that hybrid cars will be lighter and also contains less risk due to high voltage dangers.
