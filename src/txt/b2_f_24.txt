A microcomputer is a computer that has a microprocessor chip as its CPU. They are often called personal computers because they are designed to be used by one person at a time. Personal computers are typically used at home, at school, or at a business. Popular uses for microcomputers include word processing, surfing the web, sending and receiving e-mail, spreadsheet calculations, database management, editing photographs, creating graphics, and playing music or games.Personal computers come in two major varieties, desktop computers and laptop computers:Desktop computers are larger and not meant to be portable. They usually sit in one place on a desk or table and are plugged into a wall outlet for power. The case of the computer holds the motherboard, drives, power supply, and expansion cards. This case may lay flat on the desk, or it may be a tower that stands vertically (on the desk or under it). The computer usually has a separate monitor (either a CRT or LCD) although some designs have a display built into the case. A separate keyboard and mouse allow the user to input data and commands.Laptop or notebook computers are small and lightweight enough to be carried around with the user. They run on battery power, but can also be plugged into a wall outlet. They typically have a built-in LCD display that folds down to protect the display when the computer is carried around. They also feature a built-in keyboard and some kind of built-in pointing device (such as a touch pad).While some laptops are less powerful than typical desktop machines, this is not true in all cases. Laptops, however, cost more than desktop units of equivalent processing power because the smaller components needed to build laptops are more expensive.A Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) is a handheld microcomputer that trades off power for small size and greater portability. They typically use a touch-sensitive LCD screen for both output and input (the user draws characters and presses icons on the screen with a stylus). PDAs communicate with desktop computers and with each other either by cable connection, infrared (IR) beam, or radio waves. PDAs are normally used to keep track of appointment calendars, to-do lists, address books, and for taking notes.A palmtop or handheld PC is a very small microcomputer that also sacrifices power for small size and portability. These devices typically look more like a tiny laptop than a PDA, with a flip-up screen and small keyboard. They may use Windows CE or similar operating system for handheld devices.Some PDAs and palmtops contain wireless networking or cell phone devices so that users can check e-mail or surf the web on the move.Some PDAs and palmtops contain wireless networking or cell phone devices so that users can check e-mail or surf the web on the move.A workstation is a powerful, high-end microcomputer. They contain one or more microprocessor CPUs. They may be used by a single-user for applications requiring more power than a typical PC (rendering complex graphics, or performing intensive scientific calculations).Alternately, workstation-class microcomputers may be used as server computers that supply files to client computers over a network. This class of powerful microcomputers can also be used to handle the processing for many users simultaneously who are connected via terminals; in this respect, high-end workstations have essentially supplanted the role of minicomputers (see below).At UNM-A, we have a server (named Chicoma, after the tallest mountain in the Jemez) on our campus LAN that validates your login name and password when you use one of our PCs as a client workstation, and provides files to network clients. Students can also use terminals in building 3 (if we still have any in Room 306) to connect to Chicoma to run software for some of our programming classes. In our Mac lab, we use a peer-to-peer setup to allow the students to get files from the teacher’s Mac.At UNM-A, we have a server (named Chicoma, after the tallest mountain in the Jemez) on our campus LAN that validates your login name and password when you use one of our PCs as a client workstation, and provides files to network clients.

A wireless LAN (WLAN) uses radio waves to carry the network traffic. They are usually based on the IEEE 802.11 specification, also called Wi-Fi (for “wireless-fidelity”).A microcomputer is a computer that has a microprocessor chip as its CPU.

A wireless LAN (WLAN) uses radio waves to carry the network traffic. They are usually based on the IEEE 802.11 specification, also called Wi-Fi (for “wireless-fidelity”).A microcomputer is a computer that has a microprocessor chip as its CPU. They are often called personal computers because they are designed to be used by one person at a time. Personal computers are typically used at home, at school, or at a business. Popular uses for microcomputers include word processing, surfing the web, sending and receiving e-mail, spreadsheet calculations, database management, editing photographs, creating graphics, and playing music or games.Personal computers come in two major varieties, desktop computers and laptop computers:Desktop computers are larger and not meant to be portable. They usually sit in one place on a desk or table and are plugged into a wall outlet for power. The case of the computer holds the motherboard, drives, power supply, and expansion cards. This case may lay flat on the desk, or it may be a tower that stands vertically (on the desk or under it). The computer usually has a separate monitor (either a CRT or LCD) although some designs have a display built into the case. A separate keyboard and mouse allow the user to input data and commands.Laptop or notebook computers are small and lightweight enough to be carried around with the user. They run on battery power, but can also be plugged into a wall outlet. They typically have a built-in LCD display that folds down to protect the display when the computer is carried around. They also feature a built-in keyboard and some kind of built-in pointing device (such as a touch pad).While some laptops are less powerful than typical desktop machines, this is not true in all cases. Laptops, however, cost more than desktop units of equivalent processing power because the smaller components needed to build laptops are more expensive.A Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) is a handheld microcomputer that trades off power for small size and greater portability. They typically use a touch-sensitive LCD screen for both output and input (the user draws characters and presses icons on the screen with a stylus). PDAs communicate with desktop computers and with each other either by cable connection, infrared (IR) beam, or radio waves. PDAs are normally used to keep track of appointment calendars, to-do lists, address books, and for taking notes.A palmtop or handheld PC is a very small microcomputer that also sacrifices power for small size and portability. These devices typically look more like a tiny laptop than a PDA, with a flip-up screen and small keyboard. They may use Windows CE or similar operating system for handheld devices.Some PDAs and palmtops contain wireless networking or cell phone devices so that users can check e-mail or surf the web on the move.Some PDAs and palmtops contain wireless networking or cell phone devices so that users can check e-mail or surf the web on the move.A workstation is a powerful, high-end microcomputer. They contain one or more microprocessor CPUs. They may be used by a single-user for applications requiring more power than a typical PC (rendering complex graphics, or performing intensive scientific calculations).Alternately, workstation-class microcomputers may be used as server computers that supply files to client computers over a network. This class of powerful microcomputers can also be used to handle the processing for many users simultaneously who are connected via terminals; in this respect, high-end workstations have essentially supplanted the role of minicomputers (see below).At UNM-A, we have a server (named Chicoma, after the tallest mountain in the Jemez) on our campus LAN that validates your login name and password when you use one of our PCs as a client workstation, and provides files to network clients. Students can also use terminals in building 3 (if we still have any in Room 306) to connect to Chicoma to run software for some of our programming classes. In our Mac lab, we use a peer-to-peer setup to allow the students to get files from the teacher’s Mac.At UNM-A, we have a server (named Chicoma, after the tallest mountain in the Jemez) on our campus LAN that validates your login name and password when you use one of our PCs as a client workstation, and provides files to network clients.

In our Mac lab, we use a peer-to-peer setup to allow the students to get files from the teacher’s Mac.At UNM-A, we have a server (named Chicoma, after the tallest mountain in the Jemez) on our campus LAN that validates your login name and password when you use one of our PCs as a client workstation, and provides files to network clients.

A wireless LAN (WLAN) uses radio waves to carry the network traffic. They are usually based on the IEEE 802.11 specification, also called Wi-Fi (for “wireless-fidelity”).
