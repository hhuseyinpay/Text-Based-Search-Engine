Abstract
Associative lists created by the same means are remarkably different in their propensity to elicit false
memories in the DRM (Deese, 1959; Roediger & McDermott, 1995) paradigm. We confirmed this variability
in Experiment 1by constructing lists in the typical fashion but with words that were weakly associated
to their critical words. Low levels of false recall occurred. In Experiment 2 these results were
replicated at three presentation rates (.5, 1, and 3 s per word). Also, slower presentation rates yielded lower
false recall for both strong and weak lists. Experiment 3 showed that false recognition rates also varied
across lists, as did subjective ratings accompanying false recognition. We interpret these findings as supporting
an activation/monitoring framework. Lists vary in a principled way in their tendency to activate
the critical item, and slowing the presentation rate permits greater accrual of item-specific information that
makes monitoring of retrieval more accurate.  2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

Roediger and McDermott (1995), adapting
procedures used by Deese (1959), introduced a
paradigm that is now widely used to study one
type of false memories. Subjects heard either 12 or
15-item lists and were asked to recall each list
immediately after it was presented. With minor
exceptions, the lists were all composed of the
highest associates of one word in the Russell and
Jenkins (1954) word association norms. For example,
the items for one list (bed, rest, awake, etc.)
were associated to the word sleep. In immediate
free recall tests, with instructions not to guess,
these critical nonstudied words were recalled with
a high probability (.40 with 12-item lists and .55
with 15-item lists) and these rates rivaled the
probability of recall of items from the middle serial
positions of the list. False recall—recall of
events that did not actually occur—was as great or
even greater than recall of some events that did
occur. The same general outcome occurred on
recognition tests that were given after many lists
had been presented, with false alarm rates to
critical items equaling the hit rates for the list
items. False recognition of unrelated lures was
quite low, so subjects were not simply responding
positively to all test items.
The levels of false recall and false recognition
reported by Roediger and McDermott (1995)

seemed surprising, even to them, because the experiments
incorporated features that are usually
believed to discourage false memories. Subjects
were presented word lists (thought to encourage a
reproductive, rather than reconstructive mode of
recollection; Bartlett, 1932). Their recall tests immediately
followed each list and included instructions
against guessing, yielding conditions
that should have minimized false recall. In addition,
unlike other false memory paradigms, there
was no attempt to explicitly insert misleading or
false information (e.g., Loftus & Palmer, 1974).
Nonetheless, the levels of false memories (as indexed
by both objective and subjective measures)
were among the strongest ever reported in the
literature. Subjects reported that the false memories
for critical items were quite compelling when
tested either with a confidence judgment procedure
or with Tulving’s (1985) ‘‘remember’’/
‘‘know’’ procedure.
Perhaps because the results were so striking,
many researchers attempted relatively direct replications
of Roediger and McDermott’s (1995)
experiments (e.g, Payne, Elie, Blackwell, &
Neuschatz, 1996; Schacter, Verfaellie, & Pradere,
1996, among many others) seeking to confirm (or
not) their findings. The basic results are easily
replicable, and in some sense, the findings from
the DRM (Deese–Roediger–McDermott) procedure
seem to be considered commonplace now,
seven years after the original report. The prevailing
wisdom seems to be that ‘‘Of course people
recall, recognize and recollect the critical word
that is related to all the words on the list. How
could it be otherwise?’’ The interpretation of the
results reported by Roediger and McDermott
(1995) have been questioned on occasion (e.g.,
Miller & Wolford, 1999; but see Roediger &
McDermott, 1999; Wickens & Hirshman, 2000;
and Wixted & Stretch, 2000 for counterarguments),
but everyone reports strong effects of false
recall and false recognition under the conditions
that Roediger and McDermott (1995) used.
Researchers now use the DRM paradigm to
ask all sorts of interesting questions about the
arousal of these types of false memories, generally
using the 24 lists Roediger and McDermott (1995)
used or the expanded set of 36 lists published
in a norming study by Stadler, Roediger, and
McDermott (1999). In fact, because these lists
produce such robust false remembering, they have
fuelled a cottage industry aimed at reducing the
effect. Several manipulations have been identified
that can reduce false remembering relative to true
remembering (but rarely is the effect eliminated).
Such manipulations include fully debriefing subjects
about the illusion, and warning them to
avoid false memories (e.g., Anastasi, Rhodes, &
Burns, 2000; Gallo, Roberts, & Seamon, 1997;
Gallo, Roediger, & McDermott, 2001b; McDermott
& Roediger, 1998; Neuschatz, Payne,
Lampinen, & Toglia, 2001; see also Libby &
Neisser, 2001); presenting the list items in a distinctive
format such as pictures, anagrams, or visual
relative to auditory presentation (e.g., Gallo,
McDermott, Percer, & Roediger, 2001a; Hicks &
Marsh, 1999; Israel & Schacter, 1997; Smith &
Hunt, 1998); or giving subjects repeated exposures
to the study materials (e.g., Benjamin, 2001;
McDermott, 1996; Seamon et al., 2002). Many of
these investigations have been focused on the
ability of the rememberer to control their memory
accuracy via heuristics or monitoring strategies.
For instance, the reductions in false remembering
due to presenting lists in distinctive formats have
been attributed to enhanced source monitoring
(Hicks & Marsh, 1999) or other retrieval-based
heuristics that subjects can use (Israel & Schacter,
1997; Schacter, Israel, & Racine, 1999). Similarly,
warnings are most effective when given before
study (relative to after study but before test),
when subjects can strategically determine the
critical item to some lists and consciously avoid
misattributing these thoughts to actual presentation
(Gallo et al., 2001b). By emphasizing cognitive
control as a means to reduce memory errors,
these findings complement those from several
other paradigms that demonstrate that recollection-
based control processes can keep familiaritybased
errors in check (e.g., Brainerd, Reyna, &
Mojardin, 1999; Jacoby, 1991; McElree, Dolan, &
Jacoby, 1999; Rotello, Macmillan, & Van Tassel,
2000; Yonelinas, 1997).
Such approaches are theoretically important,
and are useful for developing practical means by
which false remembering can by minimized.
However, by emphasizing individual or cognitive
control over false memories they run the risk of
overlooking the potentially powerful influence of
stimulus control (see Watkins, 1991, for a discussion).
In the context of the DRM procedure,
this approach belies appreciation of a factor that
has been relatively neglected, viz., that of variability
of the potency of lists in producing false
recollection. Roediger and McDermott (1995) did
not use all of the 36 lists that Deese (1959) used in
his experiments in their own studies, for the good
reason that many of Deese’s lists did not produce
470 D.A. Gallo, H.L. Roediger, III / Journal of Memory and Language 47 (2002) 469–497
very high levels of false recall. (Deese never examined
false recognition.) Only six lists were used
in Roediger and McDermott’s first experiment
and 19 of Deese’s lists were among their 24 used in
Experiment 2. Several of Deese’s other lists rarely
produced false recall, with a critical intrusion rate
at or below 10%.
The present experiments were conceived to
address a puzzle inherent in Deese’s (1959) original
work: How can lists that are produced in exactly
the same manner (the first 15 associates of a
critical word that is not presented) produce either
very high or very low levels of false recall? As a
concrete example, consider the study lists corresponding
to the critical items bitter and sweet. The
15 associates (Russell & Jenkins, 1954) to sweet
that were used by Stadler et al. (1999) were sour,
candy, sugar, bitter, good, taste, tooth, nice, honey,
soda, chocolate, heart, cake, tart, and pie; whereas
the 15 associates to bitter that were used in Experiment
1of the present article were sweet, sour,
taste, chocolate, rice, cold, lemon, angry, hard,
mad, acid, almonds, herbs, grape, and fruit. Although
both lists seem to converge on the meaning
of their critical item and both lists seem to
have face validity in producing the effect, the
former is one of the best lists in terms of eliciting
false recall (mean¼.54), whereas we found the
latter to be one of the worst (.01). Such comparisons
should be made with caution because these
data were obtained at different universities, but
the differences are so great that we felt a more
thorough investigation of this variability was
warranted.
We set out to replicate the other, relatively
unknown, half of Deese’s work—that some lists of
associates fail to elicit false recall—and to see if the
pattern would extend to recognition measures.
Relative to recall, recognition may depend more
on familiarity than recollection (according to twoprocess
recognition models such as those of
Mandler (1980) and Jacoby (1991)) and therefore
lists that produce negligible levels of false recall
might still produce reasonably high levels of false
recognition via a similarity-based familiarity
mechanism. Although examination of types of
materials has been relatively neglected, we believe
that the theoretical stakes are high because some
theories can account for such variability more
easily than other theories.
One theory is that the theme or gist of the list is
encoded, and the critical item is subsequently remembered
because it is consistent with this gist
representation (e.g., Payne et al., 1996, cf. Brainerd,
Wright, Reyna, & Mojardin, 2001; Reyna & Brainerd,
1995). Here the critical item need not be
activated prior to retrieval, but instead it is falsely
remembered because it is consistent (i.e., has semantic
overlap or is similar in meaning) with those
items that were studied, and thus is highly familiar.
1 Another theory is that semantic features encoded
from list items (the ‘‘exemplars’’) overlap
with those of the critical item (the ‘‘prototype’’),
and this overlap leads to familiarity and hence
false remembering (e.g., a semantic featurematching
theory; Arndt & Hirshman, 1998; cf.
Anisfeld & Knapp, 1968). This theory differs from
gist-based accounts at the representational level, in
that the feature theory postulates that only individual
exemplars need be stored (e.g., Hintzman,
1986, 1988) while fuzzy trace theory postulates a
separate gist representation. At the functional level,
however, the two accounts are similar in that
both postulate that overlapping semantic features
between the studied items and the critical item can
yield false remembering. These theories make
sense in the context of most DRM studies, where
only those lists that elicit high levels of false remembering
have been used, but a potential difficulty
arises when one considers the variability
among these lists to elicit the illusion. Certain lists
produce negligible amounts of false recall, even
though they were constructed (and appear) to
converge on the meaning of their critical item.
Hence, after studying these lists, there should be a
sufficient number of overlapping semantic features
in memory to drive false remembering.
As an alternative explanation, we have developed
an activation/monitoring framework to
account for false memory effects in the DRM
paradigm and more generally (see Roediger,
Balota, & Watson, 2001b for discussion of activation
processes and Roediger, Watson, McDermott,
& Gallo, 2001c for discussion of activation/
monitoring). In brief, processing the list items (at
study or test) activates the critical nonpresented
1 The notion here is that semantic overlap exerts an
automatic or nonconscious influence at retrieval, resulting
in the subjective experience of familiarity. If the
subject instead deliberately determined semantic overlap
for a test item, then the subjective experience might be
more like a decision process than remembering (see
Whittlesea & Leboe, 2000 for a discussion). Elsewhere
we have demonstrated that such explicit decision
processes, conceptualized as item-specific criterion shifts,
do not cause DRM false remembering (Gallo et al.,
2001b).

associate, and false remembering reflects a failure
to correctly monitor the source of this activation.
This activation could be automatic spreading activation
within the semantic network (e.g., Seamon,
Luo,&Gallo, 1998; cf. Collins&Loftus, 1975) and/
or conscious thought of the item due to more
explicit associations (e.g., McDermott, 1997; cf.
Underwood, 1965). In either case, it can lead to
false remembering when the subject mistakenly
attributes this activation to the item’s occurrence
during study (e.g., a breakdown in the reality
monitoring process; Johnson & Raye, 1981;
Johnson, Hashtroudi, & Lindsay, 1993). Note that
the difference between this activation explanation
and the semantic feature overlap explanation is
nontrivial. If the former were true then the DRM
effect would be a laboratory analog of falsely
remembering internally generated events as having
been externally perceived. If the latter were true
then the effect would be analogous to falsely
remembering events that were not previously
encountered (internally or externally), but that
were consistent with one’s understanding (i.e., the
meaning) of actually perceived events.
As discussed in the context of Experiment 1,
one explanation of the list-level variability to elicit
false recall is associative strength. Although all
DRM lists consist of the 15 highest associates to a
critical (nonstudied) item, as found in free association
norms, the list items may vary in their
tendency to elicit the critical item. This factor of
‘‘backward associative strength’’ should be critical
according to activation/monitoring theory, and
indeed the sweet list has high backward associative
strength whereas the bitter list is relatively low
on this dimension. It is less clear how such a relationship
would be handled by gist or semantic
feature-based theories, although the three are not
mutually exclusive. We will discuss the relation of
these theories more thoroughly in light of the results
of the present experiments.
Experiment 1is an exploratory study in which
we attempted to verify Deese’s (1959) failure to
find false recall after presentation of certain associative
lists and see if this pattern, if obtained,
would extend to recognition procedures. Experiment
2 was designed to confirm and extend the
results of Experiment 1and to examine a variable—
presentation rate—that has produced interesting
and somewhat different results in prior
DRM experiments. In brief, slowing the presentation
rate of words beyond one second tends to
decrease false recall (McDermott & Watson, 2001;
Toglia & Neuschatz, 1996), but has little or no
effect on false recognition (Arndt & Hirshman,
1998). We found parallel effects of presentation
rate on false recall and recognition, but recognition
always followed recall in Experiment 2. Experiment
3 was designed to overcome this limitation by
omitting recall tests, and allowed us to directly
compare two types of metamemory judgments
(confidence and ‘‘remember’’/‘‘know’’/‘‘guess’’)
for false memories as a function of type of list and
presentation rate. The package of experimental
results is discussed in terms of how associative
factors and monitoring processes determine false
memories and provides important constraints for
current theories of false memories of this sort.
Experiment 1
Deese (1959) proposed that recall intrusions
varied across lists because they differed in associative
strength, or the degree to which all of the list
words were related to each other and to the critical
nonpresented word. In support of this claim, he
found that the mean backward associative strength
of a list (MBAS) was predictive of the likelihood of
that list to elicit false recall of the critical item. BAS
is the probability that a list item will evoke the
critical item as a response in a free association task.
The MBAS of a list is simply the average of all the
backward associations between each list word and
the critical item. Deese found that the probability
of a critical item’s intrusion was highly correlated
with the MBAS of the study list (r ¼ ?:87). Thus,
the more likely list items were to elicit the critical
item on a free association test, the greater the
probability of false recall from that particular list.2
2 Robinson and Roediger (1997) found that the total
backward associative strength to the critical lure
(TBAS) was the critical predictor of false recall, rather
then MBAS. TBAS is the sum of each list item’s
probability of eliciting the critical item on a free
association task (whereas MBAS is TBAS divided by
the number of items in the list). Because Deese (1959)
held list length constant (as we do in the present
experiments), the MBAS of a list was simply a linear
transformation of the TBAS. In Robinson and Roediger,
increasing the number of associates in a list (thereby
increasing both MBAS and TBAS) enhanced false
recall, but adding unrelated items to a list (thereby
decreasing MBAS but not TBAS) did not affect false
recall. Of course, both studies indicate that the degree of
associative relationship from list items to the critical
item determines the probability of false recall, and this
is the main point for present purposes.

These results were extended by McEvoy, Nelson,
and Komatsu (1999) who found that lists specifically
created to have high BAS evoked greater false
recall and false recognition than those created to
have low BAS, although their lists were constructed
in a different fashion than those of Deese (1959) and
recognition was confounded with prior recall.
In this experiment we gathered normative recall
and recognition data for lists which we
thought would elicit low levels of false recall and
false recognition (hereafter the ‘‘weak’’ lists). The
procedures employed were closely modeled after
the norming study of Stadler et al. (1999). All lists
in the present experiment were created using
procedures similar to those of Deese (1959) and
Roediger and McDermott (1995), and consisted
of the 15 words most frequently given to a
nonpresented critical item on a free association
test. The key feature was that these lists had low
MBAS, which we expected would result in low
levels of false remembering. As in Stadler et al.
(1999), each list was followed by an immediate
free recall test and a final recognition test was
given at the end of the experiment.
Method
Subjects
The subjects were 80 Washington University
undergraduates who participated for class credit
after giving informed consent.
Materials
There were 28 study lists of 15 words each, all
of which are in Appendix A. All lists consisted of
the 15 highest associates to a critical nonpresented
item, as found in the Russell and Jenkins (1954)
word association norms. As in Roediger and
McDermott (1995), words within a list were arranged
in order of decreasing relatedness to the
critical item. Relatedness was indexed by forward
associative strength (FAS), which is the probability
that the critical item elicited the list item on
the free association test. Care was taken so that
words were not repeated across lists, very similar
words were not used within a list (e.g., scene and
scenery were both listed as high associates to
beautiful, but only one was chosen for the study
list), and critical items were not used as study
items in any of the lists. In all of these instances,
the unwanted item was removed from the list and
the highest unused associate from the Russell and
Jenkins (1954) word norms was added to the end of
the list. Other than these constraints, all lists used
in this experiment were created by following
Roediger and McDermott’s (1995) procedures.
Twenty of the 28 lists were used because we felt
they would elicit relatively low levels of false recall.
Of these 20 lists, one (the king list) was chosen
from the Stadler et al. (1999) set because it had
produced the least false recall and false recognition
of all the lists they tested. Similarly, seven lists
(the beautiful, butterfly, carpet, command, mutton,
whistle, and wish lists) were chosen from the Deese
(1959) set, because Deese found that they elicited
low levels of false recall relative to the other lists he
used. Because Deese’s lists consisted of 12 items,
we added the next three highest associates from the
Russell and Jenkins (1954) word norms to each of
these lists to make them 15 items long. The final 12
lists used to elicit low levels of false memory were
created from the Russell and Jenkins norms in a
manner consistent with Roediger and McDermott
(1995), and with the constraints outlined above.
These particular lists (the bitter, cabbage, citizen,
cottage, health, justice, lamp, long, stove, swift,
trouble, and whiskey lists) were chosen because
they had relatively low MBAS (equal to or less
than .04), and the critical items did not seem to us
to be orthographically distinct or uncommon relative
to the critical items of other lists. According
to Deese’s (1959) linear regression [False recall
¼3:7 ? 1:63  MBAS], lists with MBAS of .04
should elicit levels of false recall of approximately
10%. Thus, these 12 lists were expected to elicit
relatively low levels of false recall. The average
MBAS across all of the 20 lists chosen to elicit low
levels of false recall was .028 (SD ¼ :048), whereas
it was .211 (SD ¼ :088) for the 20 lists in Stadler
et al. (1998) that produced the greatest false recall.
The BAS and FAS between each list item and
the critical item were obtained via the Nelson,
McEvoy, and Schreiber (1999) word association
norms. However, of all 420 study items (28
lists15 items/list), 59 were not found in the
Nelson et al. norms. We therefore gathered our
own free association data for these items using
similar procedures to those used in Nelson et al.
(1999). These norms were part of a larger norming
project consisting of at least 86 observations per
item (see Roediger et al. 2001c, for details). These
normative data supplemented those of Nelson
et al. (1999), and the last two columns of Table 1
present the resulting MBAS and MFAS measures
calculated for each list. Note that because list
length was held constant, MBAS and MFAS are
simply total associative strengths (TBAS and
TFAS, respectively) divided by 15.

The remaining eight study lists used in Experiment
1were chosen from the Stadler et al. (1999)
norms. We included eight of these lists so that we
could compute the correlation between our recall
and recognition data and those reported by Stadler
et al. (the city, foot, needle, pen, rough, rubber,
smoke, and trash lists), to ensure that our procedures
would lead to comparable results. These
eight lists were chosen because they had the fewest
overlapping items with the other lists used in the
present experiment. The average probability that
these lists elicited false recall and false recognition
in Stadler et al. was relatively high (.45 and .69,
respectively). A total of nine words from these
lists was replaced due to the constraints outlined
above, and the average MBAS for the resulting set
of lists was .144 (SD ¼ :051). We chose an additional
list (the lion list) from Stadler et al. to be
used as a practice list. This list was always presented
to subjects as the first list to be studied and
recalled, and the resulting data were not analyzed.
Across all 28 study lists, the average MBAS was
.061( SD ¼ :072).
After all lists had been studied and recalled, a
final recognition test was given. The recognition
test consisted of 168 items. Half of these items
were presented during the study phase and half
were not. As in Roediger and McDermott (1995),
test items were sampled from serial positions 1, 8,
and 10 of each of the 28 study lists, in addition to
the 28 critical lures. The remaining 56 items were
randomly chosen words from the Nelson et al.
(1999) norms which were unrelated to any of the
list items. Test items were randomly arranged in

two columns on test sheets, with the exception
that words from any given list would be at least
two items apart. The same test was given to all
subjects.
Design
Because the recognition test was not given until
all lists had been studied and recalled, the amount
of time between the study of a list and the final
recognition test was considerably greater for those
lists studied early in the session compared to those
studied later. To compensate for this we created
four counterbalancing conditions with 20 subjects
in each. With the exception of the practice list, the
28 study lists were randomly arranged and then
assigned numbers. One subject group studied the
lists in order (list 1–list 28), and this study order
was reversed for a second group (list 28–list 1). A
third group studied the lists in an inverted order
(list 14–list 1, and then list 28–list 15), and this
order was reversed for a fourth group. Therefore,
across subjects, each list was presented an equal
number of times in the beginning, middle, and end
of the study/recall phase.
Procedure
Subjects were tested in groups of 9–13. They
were instructed that they would hear 29 lists of 15
words, and after each list they were to write down
in any order as many of the words from that list as
they could remember. All 29 study lists were recorded
on cassette tape in a male voice at a rate of
1.5 s per word (stimulus onset asynchrony), with
the prompt ‘‘next list’’ occurring before each list.
It was emphasized that subjects should write
down only those words that they were certain they
remembered, and not to guess. After each list was
presented, the experimenter pressed the pause
button on the tape player, signaling the subjects to
recall the list.3 Each subject was given a response
booklet with the pages numbered to correspond to
the list to be recalled on that page. Subjects were
given two minutes to recall each list and were then
instructed to turn the page before the presentation
of the next list.
Following the recall of the last list, subjects
were given instructions for the recognition test.
They were told that the test consisted of some
words they had studied (old) and some words they
had not (new). Next to each word was a fourpoint
scale for them to rate their confidence that
the word had or had not been presented, ranging
from 4 (sure the item was old) to 1(sure the item
was new). Subjects were told to go through the
test at their own pace, and were instructed not to
guess. Following the recognition test, subjects
were given credit, debriefed, and thanked for their
participation.
Results and discussion
Unless otherwise noted, all results in the present
paper are significant at the .05 level, two
tailed.
Recall
Recall results are presented in Table 1, with
lists arranged in descending order of false recall of
the critical items. From the table it can be seen
that the mean proportion of false recall of critical
items ranged widely, from .54 for the rough list to
.01for the bitter, butterfly, and mutton lists. As
expected, the mean probability of false recall
from the 20 lists which we thought would elicit
low levels of false remembering was only .10
(SD ¼ :08), and over half of these lists yielded
false recall that was even lower than this level. The
mean number of all noncritical intrusions for this
set of 20 lists was .33 (SD ¼ :12) per list. In contrast
to false recall, true recall did not differ nearly
as much across lists, ranging from .72 for the
whiskey list to .55 for the rough and rubber lists
(collapsing across serial positions 1–15). For the
20 lists used to elicit low levels of false recall, true
recall was .64 (SD ¼ :05). The Pearson product–
moment correlation between true recall and false
recall was ).54 (n ¼ 28; p < :01) across lists, indicating
that lists which were better remembered
tended to elicit less false recall. Noncritical intrusions
also correlated negatively with true recall
?r ¼ :42; n ¼ 28; p < :05?.
In general, there was a high correlation between
our norms and those of previous studies.
The correlation between the recall of list items
(averaging across items 1–15) in our experiment
and in Stadler et al.’s (1999) experiment was +.90
across overlapping lists ?n ¼ 9; p < :01?. For
these lists, the average proportion of list items
recalled was .62 in our experiment and .60 in
Stadler et al. With reference to false recall, the
correlation between these two experiments was
3 For a group of 10 subjects the experimenter prematurely
hit the pause button during the presentation of the
whiskey list, so the recall and recognition results for this
list are based on 70 subjects. Also, one subject failed to
recall the rough list, so the results for this list are based
on 79 subjects.

also high, r ¼ ?:80 ?n ¼ 9; p < :05?, although
average false recall for these nine lists in the
present experiment (.27) was lower than that
found by Stadler et al. (.41). This difference in
absolute levels of false recall must be interpreted
with caution, though, because we replaced some
of the items from Stadler et al.’s lists with lower
associates in order to eliminate redundancy across
lists (as discussed previously). Considering our
norms and Deese’s (1959) experiment, false recall
correlated highly across the seven overlapping
lists, r ¼ ?:90 ?n ¼ 10; p < :01?. The mean
probability of false recall across these lists was .09
in our experiment and .07 in Deese’s experiment.
True recall for these lists was not reported by
Deese (1959). Finally, we obtained split-half correlations
on our recall data using the same procedure
as Stadler et al. Subjects were arbitrarily
divided into two groups, and for each group we
calculated the average probability of true and
false recall for each list. Much like Stadler et al.,
our data was very consistent between these two
groups: the split-half correlation for true recall
was +.83 ?n ¼ 28; p < :01? across lists, and for
false recall the correlation was +.81 ?n ¼ 28;
p < :01? across lists. Taken as a whole, the consistency
between our norms and the results of
other studies suggests that our finding of considerably
low levels of false recall for some lists
cannot simply be attributed to different subjects or
procedures.
In the present experiment, the correlation between
false recall and MBAS was significant, r ¼
?:49; n ¼ 28; p < :05, replicating Deese’s (1959)
finding. However, our correlation between MBAS
and false recall was not of the same magnitude as
Deese’s (r ¼ ?:87), and may have been lower because
we had less MBAS variability among lists
due to our list-selection criteria. In order to increase
the range in MBAS, we pooled the data from
Stadler et al.’s (1999) 36 lists with the data from the
19 lists used in the present experiment that were not
redundant with Stadler et al.’s 36 lists. The resulting
set of 55 lists had average false recall of .30
(SD ¼ :20) and averageMBASof .125 (SD ¼ :103).
On this expanded set, the correlation between false
recall and MBAS increased to +.73, n ¼ 55;
p < :01. MBAS did not correlate significantly with
true recall, and MFAS did not correlate significantly
with true recall or false recall (all p’s > :05 ).
Recognition
Recognition results are presented in Table 2,
with lists arranged in descending order of overall
false recognition of the critical item (i.e., a rating
of 3, ‘‘probably old,’’ or 4, ‘‘sure old’’). Similar to
the recall results, false recognition of critical items
ranged from extremely high (87% of subjects
falsely recognized rough) to extremely low (only
11% of subjects falsely recognized mutton). For
the 20 lists chosen to elicit low levels of false recall,
the mean probability of false recognition (.46,
SD ¼ :19) was considerably lower than that of
true recognition (.76, SD ¼ :07), collapsing across
serial positions 1, 8, and 10. Still, for nine of these
lists subjects falsely recognized the critical item at
least half the time. In addition, for all 28 lists false
recognition of the critical item was at least as high
as the false alarm rate to unrelated distracters
(.07), and in most cases it was considerably higher.
Thus, even for most of the lists that elicited low
levels of false recall, false recognition was generally
high. Of course, the recognition test was
considerably delayed relative to the recall tests
because it occurred after subjects had studied and
recalled all 28 lists. The correlation between true
recognition and false recognition across all 28 lists
was not significant (r ¼ ?:03; p > :05), consistent
with Stadler et al. (1999).
Like the recall data, our recognition data were
consistent across subsets of subjects, as the splithalf
reliability for true recognition ?r ¼ ?:83;
n ¼ 28; p < :01? and false recognition ?r ¼ ?:89;
n ¼ 28; p < :01? were both very high. For the
nine lists which were obtained from Stadler
et al. (1999), the correlation between our true
recognition data and those of Stadler et al.’s experiment
was high ?r ¼ ?:90; n ¼ 9; p < :01?.
For these lists, the average proportion of list items
recognized (collapsing across serial positions 1, 8,
and 10) was .81 in the present experiment and .71
in Stadler et al. Although the hit rate was higher
in our experiment than in Stadler et al., the false
alarm rate to unrelated items was also higher in
our experiment (.07) than in Stadler et al. (.03),
suggesting that our subjects may have been
slightly more biased to make ‘‘old’’ judgments, in
general. As was the case with true recognition,
false recognition for these nine lists correlated
highly with Stadler et al.’s results ?r ¼ ?:98;
n ¼ 9; p < :001?, and the average false recognition
for these lists in the present experiment (.67)
was very similar to that obtained in Stadler et al.’s
experiment (.64). Much like the recall data, the
consistency between the two studies suggests that
the relatively lower levels of false recognition for
many of the lists in the present experiment were
not due to different subjects or procedures.
476 D.A. Gallo, H.L. Roediger, III / Journal of Memory and Language 47 (2002) 469–497
Unlike the positive correlation between false
recall and MBAS, we failed to find a significant
correlation between false recognition and MBAS
?r ¼ ?:30; n ¼ 28; p > :05?. However, because
restriction of range in MBAS may have attenuated
this relationship, we again pooled our results
with those of Stadler et al. (1999). Across the
entire set of 55 lists, the correlation between
false recognition and MBAS was significant,
r ¼ ?:43; p < :01. Thus, as was the case with
false recall, lists with higher associative strength
yielded higher levels of false recognition, although
this relationship could have been influenced by
prior recall in the present design. MFAS did not
correlate with false recognition, and neither
MBAS nor MFAS correlated with true recognition
(all p’s > :05).
Confidence judgments
On the right of Table 2 are the percentage of
subjects that recognized each test item with high
confidence (i.e., a rating of 4, ‘‘sure the item was
old’’). Across lists, high confidence judgments were
highly correlated to the ‘‘old’’/‘‘new’’ data, because
a greater probability of recognizing an item as
‘‘old’’ would necessarily mean more opportunities
for that item to have been recognized with high
confidence. From the table it can be seen that, like
the ‘‘old’’/‘‘new’’ recognition data, high confidence
recognition of list items was relatively stable across
lists (the mean across all lists was 68%, SD ¼ 9%),
while that to critical items varied considerably
(from 80% for rough to 4% to mutton).
Of additional interest was whether there was
between-list variability in the average confidence

with which subjects falsely recognized a critical
item. In other words, did some critical items tend
to be falsely recognized with high confidence and
others with low confidence, or was false recognition
always equally compelling, even though it
occurred more often for some lists? To address
this issue, we again calculated the probability that
a critical item was falsely recognized with high
confidence, but expressed this probability as a
proportion of only those instances where the item
was falsely recognized (i.e., a rating of 3 or 4).
This procedure is particularly informative because
it expresses the probability of high confidence
false recognition independent of the total proportion
of false recognition, and as such it need
not show differences across lists that vary in the
total probability of false recognition. Nevertheless,
the rate of falsely recognized critical items
that were given a high confidence rating was 67%
(SD ¼ 16%), averaged across lists, and ranged
from 91% (for rough) to 27% (for whistle). The
same rate for unrelated lures was 29%
(SD ¼ 25%), which was at least as great as that for
the list which elicited false recognition with the
least confidence (i.e., whistle). Thus, even when
only those instances in which a subject falsely
recognized the critical item were considered, the
persuasiveness of this memory illusion varied
from list to list. Finally, the correlation across lists
between the total probability of false recognition
and the average confidence of a false recognition
judgment was +.66 ?n ¼ 28; p < :01?, suggesting
that lists which elicited more false recognition also
resulted in more compelling false recognition. The
average confidence of a false recognition judgment
also correlated with MBAS, r ¼ ?:40;
n ¼ 28; p < :05.
Relationship between recall and recognition
Like Stadler et al. (1999), we found significant
positive correlations between true recall and true
recognition, and also between false recall and false
recognition. In the present experiment, the correlation
between true recall and true recognition
across lists was +.47 ?n ¼ 28; p < :05?, and across
subjects was +.72, ?n ¼ 80; p < :001?. The correlation
between false recall and false recognition
was +.78 ?n ¼ 28; p < :001? across lists and +.61,
?n ¼ 80; p < :001? across subjects. However, as in
Stadler et al., these correlations may have been
influenced by the fact that every list was recalled
before the final recognition test.
To summarize the main results, we found low
levels of false recall for most of the lists with low
MBAS (no greater than .04) that were created in
the same fashion as those used by Roediger and
McDermott (1995). We also found that lists with
low MBAS resulted in relatively lower false recognition,
although false recognition was still quite
high relative to false alarms to unrelated distracters.
Furthermore, the average confidence
level accompanying false recognition from each
list was positively correlated with the probability
of false recognition from that list, and also with
the MBAS of that list.
Experiment 2
The purpose of Experiment 2 was to confirm
and extend the results of Experiment 1. To this
end we examined the effects of presentation rate
across lists which had been found to elicit either
high or low levels of false memory in Experiment
1and Stadler et al. (1999). Because presentation
rate has been found to affect false remembering in
this paradigm (as reviewed below), we wanted to
determine if our set of lists that elicited very low
levels of false recall would continue to do so at
other presentation rates. Manipulating presentation
rate would also provide theoretical insights
into why some lists elicit high levels of false remembering
while others do not. If the same
mechanism underlies false remembering for these
two types of lists, then presentation rate should
have the same effects on false remembering from
these lists.
Presentation rate is an interesting variable because
there are two opposing predictions as to
how presentation rate may affect DRM false
memories. On one hand, one could argue that at
slower rates subjects would have more time to
encode information that could support false remembering.
For instance, increased rehearsal of
list items at slower rates might also increase the
probability that the critical item would be thought
of as an implicit associative response at study
(Underwood, 1965). Similarly, at slower rates
subjects would have more time to engage in semantic
processing of the list items (e.g., encode
semantic features), and to focus on the overall
meaning of the list (e.g., the theme or gist). Evidence
supporting these predictions is that deeper
levels of processing at study, such as thinking of
the meaning of the list items, have been found to
increase false recall of critical items relative to
more superficial processing (Thapar & McDermott,
2001; Toglia, Neuschatz, & Goodwin,
478 D.A. Gallo, H.L. Roediger, III / Journal of Memory and Language 47 (2002) 469–497
1999). In much the same way, slower presentation
rates could lead to greater activation of the critical
item, more thorough encoding of overlapping semantic
features between the critical item and list
items, and/or more thorough encoding of gist,
each of which could increase false remembering.
On the other hand, by considering additional
factors it could be argued that slower presentation
rates would reduce the probability of false remembering.
Even if slower rates resulted in more
critical item activation or semantic feature/gist
encoding, this would not necessarily lead to more
false remembering. Rather, whether or not the
critical item is falsely remembered would also
depend critically on retrieval processes that operate
on this information. Slow presentation rates
would give subjects more time to engage in itemspecific
processing, resulting in more distinctive
recollections of each individual item (e.g., Hunt &
McDaniel, 1993). Distinctive processing of list
items might facilitate editing processes whereby
subjects are less likely to claim that they remember
the critical item when memory for it is not nearly
as compelling as memory for the list items (see
Israel & Schacter, 1997; Schacter et al., 1999). In
terms of the activation/monitoring theory, such
editing processes are conceived as enhanced reality
monitoring between memories for list items
and critical items. Slowing presentation rate might
enhance such a process (during study or test) and
thereby reduce false remembering. In terms of
gist-based theories, such editing processes could
be conceived as increased reliance on specific
traces of list items (e.g., verbatim traces in fuzzy
trace theory) to counteract the effects of gist traces
that can lead to false remembering (see Brainerd
et al., 2001). In contrast, such editing processes
are not necessarily inherent in feature-matching or
exemplar-based models. Indeed, Arndt and
Hirshman (1998) argued that MINERVA2 predicts
increments in false recognition with greater
degrees of list learning (i.e., at slower rates), not
decrements.
Studies that have manipulated presentation
rate have supported one prediction or the other,
depending on the range of presentation rates used.
Under conditions of very rapid presentation, increasing
study time increased both true and false
remembering. For instance, Roediger et al.
(2001a, Experiment 1) used rapid serial visual
presentation of DRM lists (ranging from 20 ms
per item to 320 ms per item, with a 32ms interstimulus
interval) for immediate free recall. Recall
of list items increased from .10 at 20ms to .31 at
320 ms, and false recall followed the same pattern
(.10 at 20 ms. to .33 at 320 ms). A similar trend
was observed for true and false recognition (Experiment
3), although the effects were not significant.
Seamon et al. (1998) also varied visual
presentation duration of DRM lists to determine
the effects on false recognition. They found that
both true and false recognition (adjusted for
baserate) increased as presentation duration was
increased from 20 to 2000 ms, although the effect
on false recognition was only significant in the
second of two experiments. Considered together,
these results suggest that under very rapid presentation
conditions (i.e., half a second per item
or less) neither the list items nor the critical item
or theme is activated or encoded very well. Thus,
compared to very rapid presentation conditions,
slowing presentation duration increased false recall
and recognition, which is consistent with an
increase in activation/encoding of the information
that causes false remembering.
Using slower presentation rates, Toglia and
Neuschatz (1996) have demonstrated the opposite
effect of presentation time. In their study, DRM
lists were auditorily presented to subjects at interstimulus
intervals of either 1or 4 s for immediate
free recall. Whereas accurate recall increased as
presentation rate slowed (.65 compared to .71),
false recall decreased (.72 compared to .49). These
results are consistent with the second prediction
outlined above, and suggest that subjects in the
slower rate condition were better able to use editing
processes to reduce false recall. That is, although
the studies using rapid presentation
suggest that activation/encoding of the critical
item, overlapping semantic features, or gist accrues
as presentation time is slowed, presentation
time can apparently become sufficiently slow so
that the enhanced memory for list items allows
subjects to reduce false responding. Consistent
with this claim, McDermott and Watson (2001)
have demonstrated an initial increase and eventual
decrease in false recall as a result of slowing
visual presentation duration. Specifically, increasing
presentation duration from 20, 250, 1000,
3000, and 5000 ms resulted in enhanced recall of
list items (.17, .31, .41, .48, .49) but a nonlinear
pattern for critical items (.14, .31, .22, .14, .14). It
is less clear, though, if slowing presentation time
also reduces false recognition. Arndt and Hirshman
(1998) provided relevant data. Collapsing
across relevant conditions in three of their
experiments (weighting each equally), they found
that slowing presentation duration resulted in
D.A. Gallo, H.L. Roediger, III / Journal of Memory and Language 47 (2002) 469–497 479
increased false recognition (.59–.72) at rapid durations
(300–800 ms, respectively), but further
slowing did not have an impact (.72 at 3000 ms).
Thus, increased study time increased false recognition
to a point, but slowing the rate further did
not affect false recognition.
In the present study we used a range of presentation
rates within which we felt the critical
item, semantic features, or gist could be strongly
activated/encoded even at the fastest rate (.5, 1,
and 3 s, inter-stimulus intervals; or approximately
1, 1.5, and 3.5 s SOA). As in Experiment 1, all
study items were presented auditorily, and memory
was tested using both immediate free recall
and also a final recognition test after all lists had
been presented. Based on previous research, we
predicted that slowing presentation rate would
result in decreased false recall for those lists that
have been found to elicit high levels of false remembering,
but we were unsure how rate would
affect false recognition. It was equally unclear how
lists that had elicited low levels of false remembering
would react to presentation rate. Assuming
that the same types of information cause false
remembering from both sets of lists, albeit at
quantitatively different levels, we predicted that
presentation rate would affect false remembering
from both sets of lists in a similar fashion. However,
it was possible that these weakly related lists
elicited very low levels of false recall in Experiment
1because we did not provide enough study
time for subjects to adequately grasp the theme or
gist of the lists. If this were the case, then slower
presentation rates would afford more time for
subjects to note the theme of these lists, providing
a greater chance for these lists to elicit high levels
of false recall.
Method
Subjects
The subjects were 90 Washington University
undergraduates who participated for class credit
or for $8 after giving informed consent.
Materials
Twenty-four word lists were used in this experiment.
Twelve of these lists were chosen from Stadler
et al. (1999) because they had been found to
evoke the highest levels of false recall in that study,
and will be referred to as the strong lists (the chair,
city, cup, doctor, needle, rough, sleep, smell, smoke,
soft, trash, and window lists). The sweet and anger
lists from Stadler et al. were not used because these
lists overlapped too extensively with other lists used
in this experiment. From Stadler et al., the average
probability of false recall and false recognition of
the critical items for these twelve lists were .54
(SD ¼ :07) and .77 (SD ¼ :07), respectively, and
the average MBAS from these lists is .213
(SD ¼ 0:091). The other 12 lists were those which
we found to evoke the lowest levels of false recall in
Experiment 1, and will be referred to as the weak
lists (the beautiful, bitter, butterfly, cabbage, citizen,
command, cottage, king, long, trouble, whiskey, and
whistle lists). The mutton list was not included because
this critical item is a very low frequency word
and may be unfamiliar to many students. From
Experiment 1, the average probability of false recall
and false recognition of the critical items for these
12 lists were .05 (SD ¼ :03) and .40 (SD ¼ :14), respectively,
and the average MBAS for these lists is
.036 (SD ¼ :063). Because we were not gathering
normative data for each list in this experiment, we
were not as concerned about the overlap of items
between lists as we were in Experiment 1. Thus, any
items that repeated between lists were not replaced,
except for smell in the cabbage list, which was replaced
with rabbit because of the occurrence of
smell as a critical item for another list.
The two sets of critical items did not significantly
differ in average printed word frequency
(Kucera & Francis, 1967), the mean raw count per
million was 108.75 for weak critical items and
81.83 for strong critical items, t?22? < 1. If anything,
weak critical items were slightly higher in
frequency, which typically leads to higher levels
of false alarms in other paradigms (Glanzer &
Adams, 1985).4 The two sets of lists also did not
differ in terms of interitem associative strength, or
the average number of associative connections
between list items (mean¼1.81 and 1.68 for weak
and strong lists, respectively, t?22? < 1). This
variable has been found to affect DRM false remembering
in some studies (e.g., McEvoy et al.,
1999), but not in others (e.g., Roediger et al.
2001c).
One master copy of the word lists was recorded
in a female voice on an IBM-compatible computer
4 As a follow-up analysis, we excluded the two most
frequent critical items from each of the list sets (i.e., city
for the strong lists and long for the weak lists), which
were outliers. This resulted in average critical item
frequency of 53.55 for the strong lists and 50 for the
weak lists (t?20? < 1). Analysis of the data based on
these attenuated list sets revealed the same pattern of
results and conclusions in both Experiments 2 and 3.
480 D.A. Gallo, H.L. Roediger, III / Journal of Memory and Language 47 (2002) 469–497
using sound recording software. Different interstimulus
intervals were then created by splicing
various lengths of silence (.5, 1, or 3 s) between
words on this master copy. Thus, the same recording
was used across all presentation rates.
The different versions of the master copy were
then transferred to cassette tapes, allowing subjects
to be tested in groups.
The recognition test consisted of 96 items that
were randomly ordered on test sheets, with the
exception that at least two words separated items
from the same list. As in Experiment 1, half of the
tested words had been presented during the study
phase and half had not been presented. Test items
included those words from serial positions 1, 8,
and 10, as well as the critical items from each of
the 24 lists. As discussed below, each subject
studied 16 lists, yielding a total of 48 list items on
the test. The 48 distracters were the 24 list items
from the eight nonstudied lists, and the 24 critical
items from all the lists. Because some items were
repeated across different lists, care was taken to
sample items that were unique to a given list. Due
to this constraint, four items were chosen from
serial positions other than 1, 8, or 10 (in these
cases, the next item in order was sampled). All
subjects received the same recognition test.
Design
A 3 2 mixed factorial design was used, with
presentation rate (.5, 1, and 3 s) manipulated between
subjects, and list type (strong vs. weak)
manipulated within subjects. The study lists were
divided into three sets of eight, each containing
four strong lists and four weak lists which were
randomly ordered within a set. At each of the
presentation rates, there were three counterbalancing
conditions to control for the possibility of
list study-order effects. In each counterbalancing
condition, subjects studied two sets of lists (a total
of 16 lists), and the nonstudied set was used for
distracters on the recognition test. Accordingly,
one group studied Set X followed by Set Y, another
studied Set Z followed by Set X, and a third
studied Set Y followed by Set Z. There were 10
subjects in each counterbalancing condition at
each presentation rate, resulting in 30 subjects
tested at each presentation rate.
Procedure
All procedures of Experiment 1were followed
as closely as possible. Subjects were tested in
groups of 1–12, with presentation rate manipulated
between subjects. They were instructed that
they would be presented with 16 lists of 15 words
each for immediate free recall, with instructions
that were the same as those of Experiment 1.
Because subjects clearly understood the task demands
in Experiment 1, we opted not to use a
practice list in this experiment. After the final list
had been recalled, subjects were given the recognition
test with the same instructions that were
used in Experiment 1. Following the test, they
were debriefed, given credit or paid, and thanked
for their participation.
Results and discussion
Recall
The proportion of list items (collapsing across
serial position) and critical items recalled at each
presentation rate is graphically presented in
Fig. 1. Strong list results are in the top panel (A)
Fig. 1. Proportion of list items and critical items recalled
from strong lists (A) and weak lists (B) in Experiment 2,
as a function of presentation rate. For strong lists, the
probability of true recall (across serial positions 1–15)
was .59 (.5 s), .65 (1s), and .75 (3 s), and the probability
of false recall was .47 (.5 s), .40 (1s), and .26 (3 s). For
weak lists, the probability of true recall was .62 (.5 s), .68
(1s), and .76 (3 s), and the probability of false recall was
.07 (.5 s), .05 (1s), and .02 (3 s).
D.A. Gallo, H.L. Roediger, III / Journal of Memory and Language 47 (2002) 469–497 481
and weak list results are in the bottom panel (B),
and the actual proportions are listed in the caption.
It is clear from the figure that slower presentation
rates resulted in increased recall of the
list items but decreased false recall of the critical
items. This pattern was obtained for both the
strong and the weak lists, consistent with the notion
that the same underlying mechanism causes
false remembering from these two types of lists.
As expected, false recall for weak lists was much
lower than that for strong lists at each presentation
rate, while true recall did not differ greatly.
Considering noncritical intrusions, a 2 ?list
type?  3 ?presentation rate? ANOVA indicated
that there was no effect of list type, no effect of
rate, and no interaction between the two (all
F ’s < 1). Thus, unlike critical intrusions, noncritical
intrusions did not differ from strong lists to
weak lists and were not affected by presentation
rate, although this may have been due to a floor
effect. Collapsing across rates and list types, the
mean number of all noncritical intrusions was .32,
per list.
A 2?item type?  2 ?list type?  3 ?presentation
rate? ANOVA yielded significant main effects
of item type, F ?1; 87? ¼ 674:29, MSE ¼ :029, as
recall of list items was greater than false recall of
critical items in every condition. There was also a
main effect of list type, F ?1; 87? ¼ 191:32;
MSE ¼ :011, and a significant interaction between
list type and item type, F ?1; 87? ¼ 223:41;
MSE ¼ :013. This interaction suggests that false
recall was greater (by design) for strong lists
(mean¼.38) than for weak lists (.04), whereas
true recall was relatively invariant (.66 and .69,
respectively). The main effect of rate was not significant,
but this variable did interact with both
item type, F ?2; 87? ¼ 21:09; MSE ¼ :029, and list
type, F ?2; 87? ¼ 3:42; MSE ¼ :011, and the threeway
interaction between presentation rate, item
type, and list type was also significant, F ?2; 87? ¼
4:69; MSE ¼ :013. These interactions indicate
that rate had opposite effects on true and false
recall, and that the magnitude of the effects was
different for strong and weak lists.
To evaluate the interactions between rate and
list type, we computed separate ANOVAs on
critical items and list items. A 2 ?list type?
3 ?presentation rate? ANOVA on false recall of
critical items indicated a main effect of list type,
F ?1; 87? ¼ 220:66; MSE ¼ :023, demonstrating
that false recall from strong lists (.38) was greater
than that from weak lists (.04), collapsed across
presentation rates. This replicates the key finding
in Experiment 1that there were sizable differences
in ability of lists to elicit false recall. The main
effect of presentation rate was also significant,
F ?2; 87? ¼ 7:44; MSE ¼ :035, and presentation
rate interacted with list type, F ?2; 87? ¼ 4:29;
MSE ¼ :023. The interaction suggests that false
recall from the strong lists was affected more by
presentation rate than false recall from weak lists,
although this was probably due to a floor effect
for weak lists. Separate one-way ANOVAs demonstrated
that the effects of rate on false recall
were reliable for both the strong lists, F ?2; 87? ¼
6:47; MSE ¼ :005, and weak lists, F ?2; 87? ¼
3:59; MSE ¼ :005.
Similar analysis of true recall (collapsing
across serial positions 1–15) revealed a main effect
of list type, F ?1; 87? ¼ 17:24; MSE ¼ :001, demonstrating
that recall was greater for weak lists
(.69) than for strong lists (.66), collapsing across
presentation rates. This finding is consistent with
the finding in Experiment 1that true recall correlated
negatively with false recall across lists, although
as in Experiment 1, true recall did not
differ nearly as much as false recall across lists.
The main effect of rate was also significant,
F ?2; 87? ¼ 25:83; MSE ¼ :014, with recall increasing
at slower rates, and this variable did not
interact with list type, F ?2; 87? ¼ 1:07; MSE ¼
:001.
Serial position curves for strong lists at each
presentation rate can be found in Fig. 2. These
curves were smoothed by averaging adjacent
points (e.g., the data point for serial position 4
represents the mean probability of recall for serial
positions 3–5), with the exception of the endpoints
(serial positions 1and 15) which represent the
probability of recall from those positions alone.
Dashed lines represent the mean probability of
false recall of the critical item. From the figure it
can be seen that the recall of items in middle serial
positions was affected by presentation rate to a
greater degree than recall of items at the beginning
(the primacy effect) or at the end (the recency effect)
of the list, and this may have been due to a
ceiling effect for these items. For these strong lists,
false recall became indistinguishable from recall of
list items presented in middle serial positions as
presentation rate increased. Indeed, in the .5 s
condition where false recall was greatest, recall of
list items from the middle serial positions 4–11
(.44) was no greater than false recall of the critical
items (.47), t?29? ¼ :49; SEM ¼ :053; p ¼ :63,
indicating robust levels of false remembering. In
contrast, false recall from the weak lists was
482 D.A. Gallo, H.L. Roediger, III / Journal of Memory and Language 47 (2002) 469–497
considerably low at every presentation rate, further
demonstrating that these lists do not elicit
high levels of false recall even under conditions
where subjects should have had enough time to
grasp the theme of these lists.
Recognition
Recognition data are presented in Table 3 as a
function of list type (strong vs. weak) and presentation
rate, and are divided into overall recognition
and high confidence recognition, as in Experiment 1.
In general, these data followed the same pattern as
the recall data, although they must again be
qualified with the fact that the recognition test always
followed recall testing. First, false recognition
of critical lures was higher for strong lists than
weak lists in each condition, whereas true recognition
did not differ nearly as much. Second,
slowing presentation rate appeared to increase true
recognition while decreasing false recognition for
both strong and weak lists. Finally, false alarms to
list and critical items from nonstudied lists (i.e., list

D.A. Gallo, H.L. Roediger, III / Journal of Memory and Language 47 (2002) 469–497 483
and critical item controls) were low and did not
seem to be systematically affected by presentation
rate. A 2 ?item type? 2 ?list type?  3 ?presentation
rate? ANOVA on these baserate false
alarms indicated that there was a significant interaction
between item type and list type,
F ?1; 87? ¼ 5:24; MSE ¼ :012, whereas no other
main effects or interactions were significant (all
p’s > :05). Follow-up analyses indicated that weak
critical item baserates (mean¼.05, collapsing
across rates) were significantly lower than weak list
item baserates (.09), F ?1; 87? ¼ 4:86; MSE ¼ :007,
and strong critical item baserates (.10), F ?1; 87? ¼
4:07; MSE ¼ :089. No other effects or interactions
were significant (all p’s > :10).
Such baserate variations potentially reflect idiosyncratic
differences between item types. To
adjust for these differences, these baserates were
subtracted from the recognition rates of list items
and critical items from studied lists (Schacter
et al., 1996; Seamon et al., 1998). The residual
false recognition effect (after adjustment) is considered
that which is due to the presentation of the
list of associates per se, in the absence of the influence
of idiosyncratic item differences (or other
influences) on false alarms. These adjusted data
can also be found in Table 3. Except where noted,
we report analyses only on adjusted scores.
However, the same pattern of statistical results
and general conclusions were obtained when
unadjusted scores were analyzed.
A 2?item type?  2 ?list type?  3 ?presentation
rate? ANOVA on recognition of list items
and critical items yielded a significant main effect
of item type, F ?1; 87? ¼ 137:92; MSE ¼ :056, as
true recognition was, on average, greater than false
recognition. There was also a significant main
effect of list type, F ?1; 87? ¼ 99:22; MSE ¼ :027,
and an interaction between list type and item type,
F ?1; 87? ¼ 71:01; MSE ¼ :023, again suggesting
that false recognition differed considerably
between the two types of lists, whereas true recognition
did not differ as much. The main effect of
presentation rate was significant, F ?2; 87? ¼ 3:79;
MSE ¼ :042, and this variable interacted with item
type, F ?2; 87? ¼ 10:61; MSE ¼ :056, suggesting
that slower rates decreased false recognition while
increasing true recognition. No other interactions
were significant (all p’s > :10).
We again computed separate ANOVAs on
critical items and list items. Considering the critical
items first, a 2 ?list type?  3 ?presentation
rate? ANOVA revealed a significant main effect
of list type, F ?1; 87? ¼ 108:59; MSE ¼ :039,
demonstrating that false recognition from strong
lists (mean¼.60) was greater than that from weak
lists (.30), collapsing across rates. There was also a
significant effect of rate, F ?2; 87? ¼ 10:12; MSE ¼
:067, and this variable did not interact with list
type ?p < :10?. Thus, slowing rates decreased false
recognition for strong and weak lists in a similar
fashion. For the list items, there was a main effect
of list type, F ?1; 87? ¼ 6:04; MSE ¼ :011. This
indicates that true recognition from strong lists
(.76) was greater than that from weak lists (.73),
collapsing across rate. This is the opposite pattern
than was found in true recall, although the effects
in both instances were small. The main effect of
presentation rate did not reach significance,
F ?2; 87? ¼ 2:37; MSE ¼ :031; p ¼ :10, and this
variable did not interact with list type ?F < 1?. As
opposed to the large effects of rate on false recognition,
slowing rates did not affect true recognition
that much (albeit in the expected direction).
Finally, recognition performance for the
strong lists in the .5 s condition demonstrated a
robust false memory effect: here the recognition
rate of the list items (.74) was no different than
that of the critical items (.72), t?29? ¼ :420;
SEM ¼ :051; p ¼ :68. Indeed, as can be seen from
Table 3, in all the conditions of this experiment
false recognition of the critical lures from studied
lists was higher than recognition of the comparable
items from nonstudied lists. Even in the
condition in which false recognition of critical
items was lowest (weak lists at the 3 s rate), unadjusted
false recognition of critical items
(mean¼.24) was still considerably higher than
false alarms to critical items of nonstudied lists
(.03), t?29? ¼ 6:02; SEM ¼ :035.
Confidence judgments
On the right of Table 3 are the high confidence
recognition data, which were also adjusted by
subtracting baserate false alarms. As in Experiment
1, these data necessarily overlapped highly
with the ‘‘old’’/‘‘new’’ recognition data. A
2 ?list type?  3 ?rate? ANOVA on critical items
revealed that those from strong lists (mean¼.49,
collapsing across rates) were falsely recognized
more often than those from weak lists (.19),
F ?1; 87? ¼ 161:57; MSE ¼ :026. The main effect
of rate was marginal, F ?2; 87? ¼ 2:71; MSE ¼
:069; p ¼ :07, and the interaction between list
type and rate was significant, F ?2; 87? ¼ 3:04;
MSE ¼ :026. These effects indicate that high confidence
false recognition generally decreased with
slower rates, although the effect was more
484 D.A. Gallo, H.L. Roediger, III / Journal of Memory and Language 47 (2002) 469–497
pronounced for strong lists. Similar analysis of list
items demonstrated that high confidence recognition
was slightly greater for strong than weak
lists (mean ¼.73 and .70, respectively), F ?1; 87? ¼
3:80; MSE ¼ :010; p ¼ :06. These ratings increased
with slower presentation rates, F ?2; 87? ¼
5:85; MSE ¼ :031, and there was no interaction
between list type and rate, F < 1. Finally, as with
the ‘‘old’’/‘‘new’’ data, high confidence recognition
of list items and critical items from nonstudied
lists was considerably lower than that of
list items and critical items from studied lists (all
p’s < :01).
As in Experiment 1, we calculated the proportion
of recognized items that were given high
confidence judgments. This was done only on
those items associated with studied lists (i.e., unadjusted
data), because items from nonstudied lists
were not recognized often enough to yield a
meaningful analysis. Also, because some subjects
did not falsely recognize any critical lures from the
weak lists, particularly in the 3 s condition (five
subjects), unequal numbers of observations precluded
statistical analysis on these ratings at the
subject level. Thus, the means and analyses reported
here were calculated across items instead of
across subjects. At each presentation rate, the
proportion of falsely recognized critical items given
high confidence ratings from strong lists was
.75 (.5 s), .67 (1s), and .75 (3 s), and for weak lists
was .56 (.5 s), .58 (1s), and .61 (3 s). A 2 ?critical
item type?  3 ?presentation rate? ANOVA revealed
that there was a main effect of list type,
F ?1; 33? ¼ 9:30; MSE ¼ :041, with more high
confidence ratings given to false recognition
judgments from strong lists (mean¼.72) than
from weak lists (.58). This finding is consistent
with results of Experiment 1, in which it was found
that the probability of false recognition from a list
correlated positively with the mean confidence
ratings given to false recognition from that list.
Neither the main effect of presentation rate nor the
interaction between rate and critical item type was
significant (both p’s > :10). Thus, although both
list type and rate modulated the magnitude of the
false recognition effect, only the former affected
confidence ratings for false recognition. This dissociation
bolsters the claim that different processes
underlie the effects of list type and rate on false
memory, a point to which we return in the General
discussion.
In contrast to the confidence ratings to falsely
recognized critical items, the confidence ratings
given to correctly recognized list items were
affected by presentation rate. At each presentation
rate, the proportion of high confidence ratings
given to correctly recognized list items from
strong lists was .82 (.5 s), .86 (1s), and .93 (3 s),
and for weak lists was .86 (.5 s), .89 (1s), and
.92 (3 s). A 2 ?list type?  3 ?presentation rate?
ANOVA across items revealed only a main effect
of presentation rate, F ?2; 105? ¼ 9:02; MSE ¼
:015, with no main effect of list type and no interaction
between the two (both p’s > :10). The
effect of presentation rate suggests that subjects
recognized list items with more confidence as
presentation rate slowed, as would be expected if
subjects had engaged in more elaborative,
item-specific processing at slower rates.
In sum, the findings of Experiment 2 demonstrate
that both false recall and false recognition
decreased as presentation rate was slowed from
.5 s to 3 s (inter-stimulus interval). Furthermore, it
was shown that presentation rate had the same
effect on false remembering from both strong lists
and weak lists, suggesting that the same mechanisms
cause false remembering from these two sets
of lists. We also replicated Experiment 1by
showing that strong lists resulted in greater false
recall and false recognition than weak lists, while
true remembering did not differ as much between
these two types of lists. Of course, the recognition
results were confounded with prior recall, an issue
we address in the next experiment. Finally, subjects
were equally confident in recognizing list
items from strong and weak lists, whereas they
were more confident in falsely recognizing critical
items from strong lists than weak lists. Confidence
judgments for recognized list items increased at
slower rates, but confidence judgments for falsely
recognized critical items were not affected by rate.
Experiment 3
The purpose of Experiment 3 was to explore
list level differences in false recognition when the
recognition test is not confounded with prior recall.
Roediger and McDermott (1995) found a
testing effect on true and false memories, so that
prior recall of lists enhanced subsequent recognition
of list items and critical items, although the
effect has not been universally obtained in other
studies (see Roediger, McDermott, & Robinson
(1998), for a discussion). In those instances where
the effect is found, the facilitation of both true and
false recognition may be due to similar mechanisms,
such as retrieval practice or the additional
D.A. Gallo, H.L. Roediger, III / Journal of Memory and Language 47 (2002) 469–497 485
encoding opportunity provided by prior recall (cf.
Tulving, 1967). However, it is unknown if these
mechanisms will affect strong and weak lists
equivalently, so that the causes of list-level differences
in false recognition of Experiments 1and
2 are unclear.
We addressed this issue in the present experiment
by using the same materials and design as
Experiment 2, with only two exceptions. First,
during the 2 min between each study list’s presentation
subjects completed math problems instead
of recalling the list. We could therefore be
confident that any list-level differences in the
present experiment are not due to prior recall.
This design also allowed us to determine if prior
recall was responsible for the effects of rate on
false recognition in Experiment 2. Slower rates
decreased false recognition in Experiment 2, but
Arndt and Hirshman (1998) did not find consistent
reductions in false recognition at slower rates
(in the absence of prior recall), suggesting that our
effects may have been driven by prior recall. Second,
all subjects in Experiment 3 received the
same recognition test as in Experiment 2, but half
the subjects made confidence judgments to these
items (as in Experiment 2), and the other half
made ‘‘remember’’/‘‘know’’ judgments to these
items. This was done to replicate the list-level
variability in false recognition confidence judgments
found in Experiment 1and 2, and also to
determine if these differences would extend to
‘‘remember’’/‘‘know’’ judgments. To anticipate,
both subjective judgments yielded very similar
patterns of results.
A final issue of interest is the level of false
alarms to list items and critical items from nonstudied
lists (i.e., nonstudied control items). In
Experiment 2 these baserates were consistently
low (at or below 13%), but they were significantly
higher for critical item controls from strong lists
than those from weak lists. This result was unexpected,
because the corresponding lists were never
studied and hence all of these items should have
been relatively unfamiliar to the subjects. However,
Roediger and McDermott (1995) found that
critical item controls had higher baserates than
corresponding list item controls, and similar effects
were subsequently reported (e.g., Gallo et al.,
2001a,b; Schacter et al., 1996; Seamon et al.,
1998). The fact that we found baserate differences
between critical item controls from strong and
weak lists suggests either that these items have
idiosyncratic differences, or that other factors
influenced these baserates. We were therefore
interested to see if such differences would be replicated
in the present experiment, when no recall
test occurred prior to the recognition test.
Method
Subjects
The subjects were 90 Washington University
undergraduates who participated for class credit
after giving informed consent.
Materials and design
As in Experiment 2, 30 subjects were randomly
assigned to each presentation rate condition (.5, 1,
or 3 s per word). The same word lists and counterbalancing
procedures were employed as in Experiment
2. There were only two differences
between this experiment and the last. The first is
that subjects in the present experiment were each
given a 16-page booklet of multiplication problems,
so they could do math after each list instead
of recall. The second is that half the subjects in
each rate condition made confidence judgments to
test items (using the same test as in Experiment 2),
whereas the other half made ‘‘remember’’/
‘‘know’’/‘‘new’’ judgments (explained below).
Importantly, the two recognition tests had the
same items arranged in the same random order,
and the only difference was that decision choices
to the right of each item was either a 1–4 confidence
scale or an ‘‘R’’/‘‘K’’/‘‘New’’ judgment,
respectively.
Procedure
Subjects were told that this was an experiment
of memory and mathematics abilities. As in the
previous experiments, they were told that they
would hear 16 lists and that they should pay attention
to each item in the list because their
memory would be tested after all lists had been
studied. After each list, they were told to turn
their booklet to a new page of multiplication
problems and to accurately complete as many
problems as possible. They were asked to use this
time only to focus on the math problems, and to
avoid writing any of the list items on the math
pages. No subject completed an entire page of
math problems in the 2 min.
Following the last page of math problems,
subjects received recognition test instructions. For
those subjects making confidence judgments, these
instructions were identical to those of the previous
experiment. For those making ‘‘remember,’’
‘‘know,’’ and ‘‘new’’ judgments the instructions
486 D.A. Gallo, H.L. Roediger, III / Journal of Memory and Language 47 (2002) 469–497
were modified slightly (see Gardiner, 1988; Rajaram,
1993). Specifically, they were to make a
‘‘remember’’ judgment if the test word brought to
mind a specific detail about the word’s occurrence
in the study list. ‘‘Know’’ judgments were to be
made when the subject felt that they knew the
word had been presented, but could not recollect
any specific details about its actual occurrence. If
the subject did not think the word was ‘‘old,’’ i.e.,
they neither ‘‘remembered’’ nor ‘‘knew’’ that it
had been presented, they were to circle ‘‘new.’’
Results and discussion
Recognition data for each item type are presented
in Table 4 as a function of list type (strong
vs. weak), test format (confidence vs. ‘‘remember’’/‘‘
know’’ judgments) and presentation rate.
The first point to notice is that, in all conditions,
strong critical items were falsely recognized more
often than weak critical items, replicating the results
of Experiment 2. Strong list items were also
recognized more often than weak list items, although
as in Experiment 2, this difference was not
nearly as large as that for critical items. With respect
to presentation rate, recognition of list items
generally increased at slower presentation rates,
whereas false recognition of critical items did not
appear to be systematically affected by rate. Finally,
as in the previous experiment, baserate false
alarms to strong critical items (i.e., those from
nonstudied lists) tended to be somewhat higher
than were those to weak critical items. A
2 ?item type?  2 ?list type?  2 ?test format? 3
?presentation rate? ANOVA on these baserate
data indicated a main effect of list type,
F ?1; 84? ¼ 18:42; MSE ¼ :035, and an interaction
between list type and item type, F ?1; 84? ¼
10:57; MSE ¼ :03. No other main effects or interactions
were significant. Follow-up analyses
revealed that baserates to strong critical items
(.33) were greater than those to strong list items
(.26), t?89? ¼ 2:48; SEM ¼ :027, and baserates to
weak critical items (.19) were lower than were
those to weak list items (.24), t?89? ¼ 2:32;
SEM ¼ :022, and strong critical items, t?89? ¼
4:53; SEM ¼ :032. There were no differences in
baserate responding to list items from strong lists
(.26) and weak lists (.24), t?89? ¼ 1:20; SEM ¼ :021.
Because of these baserate differences we report
analyses on the adjusted data, although as in the
previous experiment the same conclusions were

D.A. Gallo, H.L. Roediger, III / Journal of Memory and Language 47 (2002) 469–497 487
obtained with analysis of the raw data. A
2 ?item type?  2 ?list type?2 ?test format?  3
?presentation rate? ANOVA on these data indicated
a main effect of list type, F ?1; 84? ¼ 5:82;
MSE ¼ :063, and a main effect of rate, F ?2; 84? ¼
3:29; MSE ¼ :134. No other main effects or interactions
were significant. As in the previous experiment
we computed separate ANOVAs on
false recognition and true recognition, collapsing
across test format because there were no main
effects or interactions involving this variable. Data
collapsed across test format can be found in the
last three columns of Table 4.
Turning to the critical items first, a 2 ?list
type?  3 ?presentation rate? ANOVA revealed a
significant main effect of list type, F ?1; 87? ¼
3:83; MSE ¼ :076, demonstrating that false recognition
from strong lists (mean¼.49) was
greater than that from weak lists (.41), collapsing
across rates. There was no main effect of rate and
no interaction (both F ’s < 1). Although these listlevel
differences in false recognition are consistent
with the previous experiment, the absence of an
effect of rate on false recognition is not. Apparently,
the effect of rate on false recognition in
Experiment 2 was driven by prior recall. The same
analysis on list items indicated a main effect of list
type, F ?1; 87? ¼ 4:28; MSE ¼ :024. This shows
that true recognition from strong lists (.48) was
greater than that from weak lists (.44), collapsing
across rate. There was also a significant main
effect of presentation rate, F ?2; 87? ¼ 6:77; MSE ¼
:062, and this variable interacted with list type,
F ?2; 87? ¼ 3:43; MSE ¼ :024. The interaction
suggests that rate had a larger effect on recognition
of strong list items than weak list items, although
follow-up analyses indicated that the
effects were significant in each case.
Finally, list items and critical items from studied
lists were recognized more often than their respective
controls (i.e., baserate false alarms). Collapsing
across rate and test format, this held for strong list
items (.75 vs. .26, respectively, t?89? ¼ 21:63;
SEM ¼ :022), weak list items (.67 vs. .24, t?89? ¼
18:43; SEM ¼ :024), strong critical items (.82 vs.
.34, t?89? ¼ 13:45; SEM ¼ :037), and weak critical
items (.60 vs. .19, t?89? ¼ 13:92; SEM ¼ :03). These
findings demonstrate robust true and false memory
in all conditions, despite differences between lists in
the overall magnitude of the effects.
Subjective judgments
We turn lastly to the subjective judgments (i.e.,
confidence and ‘‘remember’’/‘‘know’’) made to list
items and critical items on the recognition test. As
previously discussed, the pattern of results from
each test format, when expressed simply as proportion
of items called ‘‘old,’’ were remarkably
similar. This similarity was also upheld when we
examined only those items that were recognized
with high confidence (i.e., a ‘‘sure old’’ judgment)
or with a ‘‘remember’’ judgment, both of which
could be argued to reflect instances where subjective
remembering was particularly compelling.
Table 5 presents these data for each item type in
each of the conditions, following the same format
as Table 4. That is, the proportion of items recognized
as ‘‘sure old’’ are listed for the confidence
format, and the proportion of items recognized as
‘‘remembered’’ are listed for the ‘‘remember’’/
‘‘know’’ format. As can be seen, the pattern of
results from the two testing formats was quite
similar, and with only a few unsystematic exceptions,
the means of comparable conditions across
the two formats corresponded well with each
other. Note that this similarity of results does not
necessarily indicate that ‘‘remember’’ judgments
are synonymous with high confidence judgments
(for dissociations between the two see Gardiner &
Java (1990) and Rajaram (1993)), but it does
suggest that the same types of retrieved information
can influence both judgments (cf. Tulving,
1985).
As with the overall proportions of ‘‘old’’
judgments, we collapsed across test format and
analyzed adjusted false recognition and true recognition
separately. A 2 ?list type?  3 ?presentation
rate? ANOVA on the proportion of critical
items falsely recognized yielded a main effect of
list type, F ?1; 87? ¼ 28:26; MSE ¼ :065, with no
effect of rate and no interaction (both p’s > :10).
The main effect of list type demonstrates that false
recognition to critical items from strong lists was
more compelling than that from weak lists. Collapsing
across rate, separate analyses indicated
this was true for ‘‘remember’’ judgments (mean
¼.42 for strong lists and .30 for weak lists,
t?44? ¼ 2:09; SEM ¼ :058) as well as for high
confidence judgments (.53 vs. .25, respectively,
t?44? ¼ 6:18; SEM ¼ :046). A similar analysis on
list items, again collapsing across test formats,
indicated a main effect of rate, F ?2; 87? ¼ 4:61;
MSE ¼ :063, demonstrating that confidence and
‘‘remember’’ judgments increased with slower
rates, as would be expected. There was also an
effect of list type, F ?1; 87? ¼ 6:58; MSE ¼ :014,
and no interaction ?F < 1?. This effect suggests
that recognition of strong list items was more
488 D.A. Gallo, H.L. Roediger, III / Journal of Memory and Language 47 (2002) 469–497
compelling than that of weak list items. Separate
analysis indicated that this difference was reliable
for ‘‘remember’’ judgments (mean¼.40 vs. .33,
respectively, t?44? ¼ 2:65; SEM ¼ :028) but not
for high confidence judgments (.46 vs. .44, t < 1).
As in the previous experiment, we analyzed
unadjusted ‘‘remember’’ and high confidence
judgments expressed as a proportion of the total
probability of false alarms, collapsing across rate.
With this comparison the difference in ‘‘remember’’
judgments to critical items from strong lists
(.65) and weak lists (.59) failed to reach significance,
t?43? ¼ 1:48; SEM ¼ :041; p > :10, although
the effect was in the predicted direction.
(One subject was excluded from this last analysis
because they did not say ‘‘old’’ to any strong
critical items.) With respect to high confidence
false alarms, strong critical items (.75) yielded
significantly more false recognition than weak
critical items (.52), t?44? ¼ 5:21; SEM ¼ :045. A
similar analysis on list items demonstrated no
difference for either ‘‘remember’’ judgments
(mean¼.67 for strong lists and .64 for weak lists,
t < 1) or high confidence judgments (.71 vs. .73,
respectively, t?44? ¼ 1:04; SEM ¼ :022; p > :10).
The finding that some critical items elicit more
high confidence and ‘‘remember’’ false alarms
than others suggests that false recognition from
strong lists was more compelling than that from
weak lists.
To summarize, the results of this experiment
demonstrate that lists varied not only in the probability
with which they elicited false recognition,
but also in terms of how subjectively compelling
the illusory memory was. False recognition from
strong lists was accompanied with more ‘‘remember’’
and high confidence judgments than that from
weak lists. Further, these differences were maintained
when subjective judgments were adjusted
for baserates, and also when they were expressed as
proportions of the total probability of falsely recognized
items in each condition (although this
latter difference did not reach significance for ‘‘remember’’
judgments). Despite these differences
across lists, it is worthwhile to note that ‘‘remember’’
and high confidence judgments to falsely
recognized critical items were always greater when
the list had been studied (Table 5, Rows 3 and 7)
than when the list had not been studied (Rows 4
and 8). Thus, even weak lists elicited high levels of
subjectively compelling false recognition relative to
this nonstudied baserate.

Comparing Experiments 2 and 3
Other than the lack of an effect of rate on false
recognition, there were two notable differences
between these recognition results and those of
Experiment 2. To quantify these differences we
directly compared the results of the two experiments,
which was justified because the methodology
between the two was similar by design, as was
the subject population. The first difference is that
list items were not recognized as often in the
present experiment as they were in the previous
experiment. Comparing unadjusted hit rates
(collapsing across rate), this was true for both
strong lists (mean¼.75 and .84, respectively,
t?178? ¼ 5:31; SEM ¼ :017) and weak lists (.67 vs.
.81, t?178? ¼ 6:71; SEM ¼ :02). (Even larger
effects were found when baserate-adjusted hit
rates were compared, for reasons discussed below.)
This testing effect is consistent with previous
research that has demonstrated that the act of
prior recall can boost recognition performance for
list items (e.g., Roediger & McDermott, 1995). A
similar effect may have operated on critical items,
but the differential effects of rate across the two
experiments make this difficult to determine.
A more dramatic difference between the two
studies was that false alarms to control items from
nonstudied lists (i.e., baserates) in the present experiment
were considerably higher than they were
in the previous experiment. Comparing Tables 3
and 4 it is clear that this was true for every item
type in every condition. In fact, even the smallest
difference between the two experiments was statically
reliable (i.e., baserates for weak list items
were .19 in the 3 s condition of the present
experiment and .09 in that of Experiment 2,
t?58? ¼ 3:17; SEM ¼ :033). We did not expect
such differences between experiments, and we offer
a potential explanation in the next section.
General discussion
The results of these experiments demonstrate
an important point about the DRM false memory
illusion: Lists that are constructed just like those
of Roediger and McDermott (1995) (the first 15
associates of a nonstudied word) can fail to elicit
high levels of false recall, despite this associative
connection. The strong positive correlation between
MBAS and false recall indicated that this is
a critical factor in the degree to which lists will
elicit such errors, as Deese (1959) demonstrated.
We also extended Deese’s original findings by
demonstrating that false recognition was correlated
with MBAS, consistent with McEvoy et al.
(1999). An important new finding was that false
recognition from lists with low MBAS was less
compelling than that from lists with higher
MBAS, as indexed by confidence ratings and
‘‘remember’’ judgments (Experiment 3). Another
(rather surprising) finding was that list-level differences
were also evident in false alarms to critical
item controls (when the corresponding list
had not been studied), as these baserates were
higher for strong critical items than weak critical
items. Finally, we demonstrated that slowing
presentation rates decreased false recall and recognition
from both strong and weak lists
(Experiment 2), but the effects of rate on false
recognition disappeared when prior recall was
eliminated (Experiment 3). Therefore, when recognition
is not compromised by prior recall, our
results more closely resembled those of Arndt and
Hirshman (1998).
In what follows we consider each of these results
in turn, as well as their theoretical implications.
The strong relationship between MBAS and
false remembering constrains theories of how the
information that leads to DRM false remembering
is represented in memory. MBAS is an index
of the degree of association between the list items
and the critical item, and thus it can be considered
a direct predictor of the amount of associative
activation that the critical item receives when its
associates are processed. Within the activation/
monitoring theory, this activation could be conceived
as automatic spreading activation within
semantic memory that could leave a lasting effect,
especially if it occurred repeatedly and/or yielded
conscious thoughts of the critical item. Associates
from lists with low MBAS would be less likely to
activate the critical item, and therefore this information
would not be as available during retrieval
as it would be for lists with greater MBAS.
As a result, subjects would be less likely to erroneously
believe that weak critical items occurred
in the study list relative to strong critical items.
This activation/monitoring theory can account for
the similar effects of associative strength on false
recall and false recognition, because in both instances
subjects would have falsely remembered
the critical item to the degree that it was activated
by list items and this activation was attributed to
study (see Roediger, Balota, & Watson, 2001b,c).
The notion of differential activation from list
to list can also explain why lists that elicited more
false recognition also elicited more compelling
490 D.A. Gallo, H.L. Roediger, III / Journal of Memory and Language 47 (2002) 469–497
false recognition, as indexed by confidence ratings
and ‘‘remember’’ judgments. If lists with greater
MBAS resulted in more activation of the critical
item, then this additional activation may have
made these items more retrievable (and/or more
familiar) at test. Differences in familiarity could
explain list-level variability in high confidence
judgments, but the fact that ‘‘remember’’ judgments
followed a similar pattern as high confidence
judgments suggests that lists also varied in
their ability to evoke false recollection of the
nonpresented item’s occurrence. Such false recollections
could be explained by conscious activation
(thoughts) of the critical item at study, which
the subject later recollected and misattributed to
actual presentation. If it is assumed that the
probability of recollecting such thoughts depends
on their prior frequency, and also that their prior
frequency depends on the strength of association
between the list and the critical item, then one
might expect more ‘‘remember’’ judgments following
more strongly related lists. Alternatively,
processes other than the recollection of prior
thoughts may cause ‘‘remember’’ judgments. For
instance, in an effort to determine if a critical test
item had been studied, the subject may imagine
the critical item’s study presentation upon encountering
it at test. Depending on the level of
familiarity of this item (due to associative activation),
this imagination may be confused with actual
recollection and result in a ‘‘remember’’
judgment (for further discussions of memory attributions,
see Jacoby, Kelley, & Dywan, 1989;
Johnson et al., 1993).
Gist or schema-based theories and semantic
feature-based theories would have difficulty
accounting for the relationship between MBAS
and false remembering without making an additional
critical assumption. Specifically, they would
have to assume that strong associates share more
semantic overlap with the critical item than do
weak associates, and therefore a stronger gist trace
(or more overlapping semantic features) is
encoded for lists with greater MBAS. We are
hesitant to make this assumption because the types
of associations that are measured by free association
tasks (and hence MBAS) are not necessarily
semantic, or based on similarity of meaning.
Instead, these associations are probably driven by
a variety of factors (e.g., statistical co-occurrence
in natural language) that could cause one concept
to activate another. A more direct test of these
theories would require a more direct measure of
gist or semantic overlap for DRM lists, one that
does not rely on associations, but we know of no
such measure. Based on intuition, lists with strong
MBAS do not appear to have more semantic
overlap with the critical item than lists with weak
MBAS (at least when forward associative strength
is relatively constant). Indeed, in all of these lists
there are many items that have semantic overlap
with the critical item, as demonstrated by the
bitter-sweet example used in the Introduction.
Both lists appear to converge on the meaning of
their critical items, but they differ greatly in MBAS
(.011 and .172, respectively), and also in the mean
probability of false recall and recognition.5 This
and other examples suggest that the semantic
overlap account, although potentially applicable
(see below), needs to be more rigorously defined in
order to determine if it can account for the
variability among lists to elicit false remembering.
We have argued that the variability among lists
to elicit false remembering is most consistent with
theories that propose that the critical item is activated
from semantic memory and forms a lasting
representation. Other evidence that such activation
occurs in DRM is that the presentation of
these lists yields priming of the critical item on
implicit memory tests (McDermott, 1997; McKone
& Murphy, 2000). The tests used in these
studies are thought to be sensitive to both perceptual
representations and the activation of abstract
lexical representations (e.g., Rajaram &
Roediger, 1993), suggesting that the lexical representation
of the critical item was activated. It is
unclear how gist-based representations, which by
definition are not item-specific, could support
such priming without additional assumptions.
This is not to say that such mechanisms play no
role in DRM false memories. Most of our lists
that elicited the lowest levels of false recall still
resulted in false recognition that was well above
the false alarm rate to unrelated distracters. These
5 A reviewer suggested that the bitter list converges on
two different meanings of its critical item, whereas the
sleep list does not, and that this might be the cause of the
differences between these lists. However, close inspection
of our other weak lists reveals that this is the exception,
and not the rule. Further, it is unclear why activation of
different meanings of the same word would be predicted
to yield low levels of false remembering. The smell list
consists of words that converge on the verb (breathe,
sniff, hear, see, whiff) the noun (aroma, scent, reek,
stench, fragrance) and that are in other ways associated
to smell, and this list elicited one of the highest levels of
false recall (60%) in the Stadler et al. (1999) norms.

relatively high false recognition rates make sense
if one assumes that familiarity (via semantic feature
or gist overlap) may contribute more to recognition
tests (where the test item is presented to
the subject for a decision) than recall tests (see
Mandler, 1980; Jacoby, 1991).
Perhaps the strongest evidence that featurebased
or gist-based processes are involved, in addition
to the activation processes advocated here,
comes from the differential effects of delay on true
and false memories. One prediction of prototypebased
models is that abstract representations
should be more resistant to forgetting than memory
for individual exemplars (e.g., Posner & Keele,
1970). Similarly, fuzzy trace theory posits that gist
traces are more resistant to forgetting (or interference)
than verbatim (or item-specific) traces
(e.g., Reyna & Lloyd, 1997), and exemplar-based
or feature-based models also predict greater acceptance
of prototypes than exemplars after a delay
(e.g., Hintzman, 1986). Consistent with this
prediction, several researchers have found that
recall of list items decreases more over a delay than
recall of critical items (e.g., Seamon et al., in press
a; Toglia et al., 1999), although the picture is less
clear for true and false recognition (e.g., Lampinen
& Schwartz, 2000; Seamon et al., in press a; Thapar
& McDermott, 2001). Activation-based theories
have difficulty accounting for this interaction
between item type and retention interval, especially
when rates of true and false remembering
were equivalent on the first memory assessment.
In addition to these processes that characterize
the nature of the information that causes false
remembering, the fact that slower presentation
rates decreased false recall in Experiment 2 suggests
that additional processes are involved. As
mentioned earlier, one candidate process is the
monitoring of memory accuracy (see also
McDermott & Watson, 2001). Slower presentation
rates may have provided more time to engage
in distinctive item-specific processing of the lists,
such as mental imagery or rehearsal. As a result,
even though the critical item may have been
equally activated/encoded at every rate, or even
more activated/encoded at slower rates, this
would have been offset by subjects’ increased utilization
of item-specific recollections to distinguish
between presented and nonpresented words.
For instance, at slower rates subjects who thought
of the critical item may have been more likely to
realize (during study) that it was not presented,
thereby reducing subsequent source confusions
(see Bredart, 2000). Monitoring processes may
also have occurred at test. At slower rates subjects
may have demanded more distinctive item-specific
recollections before producing an item on the recall
test. As a result, subjects would have been less
likely to recall nonpresented items that did not
benefit from enhanced item-specific processing at
slower study rates.
Gist-based theories could explain the effect of
presentation rate by assuming that slowing rate
differentially increases the storage of verbatim
traces, relative to gist traces. As a result, subjects
might have relied more on verbatim than gist
traces at retrieval, which would have reduced false
remembering. Exactly how subjects would switch
reliance on these different types of traces is unknown,
but one explanation is that they use
monitoring processes similar to those discussed
above. It is less clear how semantic feature-based
models would account for the present effects of
rate on false recall, because they predict increases
in false remembering under conditions where
feature encoding should be enhanced (i.e., slower
rates). However, if a monitoring process were
applied to the output of these models then they
too could fit the obtained pattern.
One unexpected result was that slowing rate
decreased false recognition when the test was
preceded by recall (Experiment 2), but not when it
was preceded by math (Experiment 3). This finding
is inconsistent with a monitoring account,
because the monitoring process should presumably
operate during either recall or recognition
tests. One explanation is that in the present experiments
recall always came immediately after a
list’s presentation, where monitoring processes
that rely on item-specific memory should be
greatest, and recognition tests were administered
after all lists had been studied. This may have
made the recall tests more sensitive to monitoring
processes than the recognition tests, leading to an
effect of rate on the former but not the latter. This
may not matter, though, because Arndt and
Hirshman (1998) also found that slowing rate did
not reduce false recognition, and their results were
based on recognition tests administered after each
list’s presentation. A more intriguing possibility is
that recall is, in general, more sensitive to such
monitoring processes than recognition (see Koriat
& Goldsmith, 1996). Thus, it may require more
dramatic changes in presentation rate to affect
false recognition than false recall.
Another question that arises from the previous
analysis is that, if slowing presentation rate was
insufficient to support effective monitoring on our
492 D.A. Gallo, H.L. Roediger, III / Journal of Memory and Language 47 (2002) 469–497
recognition tests, what drove the effects of rate on
false recognition in Experiment 2? As mentioned
earlier, the major methodological difference between
Experiments 2 and 3 was that all lists were
recalled prior to recognition in Experiment 2.
Prior recall probably affected false recognition in
two ways. The first is that, in the fast rate conditions,
subjects were more likely to recall critical
items, and were thus more likely to later falsely
recognize these items due to a failure of sourcemonitoring.
However, this factor alone is not
sufficient to account for the present results. If the
effects of rate on false recognition in Experiment 2
were due solely to prior recall of critical items,
then a conditional analyses should reveal no effects
of rate on false recognition for those critical
items that were not previously recalled. This was
not the case. For strong lists, the conditionalized
probability of false recognition was .70 at the .5 s
rate, .63 at the 1s rate, and .47 at the 3 s rate,
F ?2; 89? ¼ 5:12; MSE ¼ :078. For weak lists these
probabilities were .36 at the .5 s rate, .39 at the 1s
rate, and .23 at the 3 s rate, F ?2; 89? ¼ 4:36;
MSE ¼ :047. Such conditional analyses should be
interpreted with caution, as they are susceptible to
item-selection artifacts, but such artifacts cannot
explain the results for weak lists, because these
items were rarely falsely recalled (and hence conditionalized
scores are not much different than the
unconditionalized scores). Because rate affected
false recognition even for those items that were
not previously recalled, some factor other than
previous recall of critical items was involved.
A likely explanation is that prior recall boosted
memory for list items, which is reflected in the
greater recognition of these items in Experiment 2
than Experiment 3. Because more list items were
recalled at slower presentation rates, one would
expect this testing effect to be greatest in the 3 s
condition. One result of such a testing effect would
be to enhance monitoring strategies that rely on
recollection of list items. Thus, although the recognition
test may not have been sensitive to
monitoring processes supported by the effects of
rate alone (Experiment 3), these effects of rate, in
addition to the effects of prior recall on list items,
may have enhanced the effectiveness of monitoring
processes in Experiment 2. It is less clear how
gist-based theories would explain this effect of
prior recall; according to fuzzy-trace theory prior
recall in the DRM paradigm should strengthen
gist traces and hence increase false recognition
(Brainerd et al., 2001). Thus, if anything, increasing
prior recall should have led to more false
recognition as rate decreased, but the opposite
result was found. The notion that prior recall
enhanced monitoring processes also explains the
otherwise puzzling finding that false alarms to list
items and critical items from nonstudied lists (i.e.,
control items) were lower in Experiment 2 than in
Experiment 3, across the range of presentation
rates. The enhanced recollection of list items due
to prior recall may have facilitated the discrimination
between list items and unrelated lures,
leading to fewer false alarms of these items in
Experiment 2.
We turn lastly to false alarms to control items.
As discussed, previous research has found that
these baserates are somewhat greater for critical
items than for list items, and in the present experiments
we found them to be greater for strong
critical items than for weak critical items. These
baserate differences did not compromise our major
findings, because our results were maintained even
after these baserates were taken into account (via
subtraction). Nevertheless, these baserates are interesting
to consider in their own right. One possibility
is that these control items received some
associative activation from related items that
happened to occur before them on the test. Marsh,
McDermott, and Roediger (in press) reported that
critical item controls were more likely to be falsely
recognized if they were preceded by related list
items on the test (but this manipulation did not
affect critical items from studied lists). Because
strong critical items are more highly related to
their list associates than are weak critical items,
differences in such test activation could have driven
the baserate differences found here. Regardless
of the explanation, the fact that such differences do
exist suggests that results from studies in which
background false alarm rates are not experimentally
measured should be interpreted with caution.
Considered as a whole, the evidence from these
new experiments (as well as other results reviewed
here) demonstrates that the creation of false
memories in the DRM paradigm involves at least
two factors: (1) the activation and/or encoding of
information that can cause false remembering and
(2) monitoring or editing processes that modulate
the extent to which this information yields false
remembering. The strong relationship between
MBAS and false recall and false recognition is
most consistent with theories that emphasize associative
activation of the critical item, as opposed
to gist or semantic feature-based theories (see
Roediger et al., 2001b). These other mechanisms
are probably involved, with the relative contri-
D.A. Gallo, H.L. Roediger, III / Journal of Memory and Language 47 (2002) 469–497 493
bution of each type of information potentially
depending on task dynamics (e.g., recall vs. recognition,
retention interval). More importantly,
the wide range of variability among lists to elicit
this illusion indicates that it is highly sensitive to
subtle stimulus manipulations, whereas the effects
of rate on false recall suggest that the illusion is
also sensitive to monitoring processes. These two
observations indicate that both the stimuli and the
individual exert control over false memories.
However, it should be stressed that most of the
DRM demonstrations of individual or cognitive
control depend on monitoring processes that, in
turn, depend on stimulus characteristics (e.g.,
presentation rate, presentation format, presentation
modality, and number of presentations). As
previously discussed, even instructing subjects to
avoid this illusion via warnings and examples
(arguably the loudest call to arms of cognitive
control) was most effective when given before
study, when it could influence how the stimuli
were initially processed. Based on these findings, it
appears that individual control of memory accuracy
primarily depends on characteristics of the
to-be-remembered material.
