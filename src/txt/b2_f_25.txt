Dogs have been selectively bred for thousands of years, sometimes by inbreeding dogs from the same ancestral lines, sometimes by mixing dogs from very different lines.[1] The process continues today, resulting in a wide variety of breeds, hybrids and types of dog. Dogs are the only animal with such a wide variation in appearance without speciation, "from the Chihuahua to the Great Dane".[2]The following list uses a wide interpretation of "breed". Breeds are usually categorized by the functional type from which the breed was developed. The basic types are companion dogs, guard dogs, hunting dogs, herding dogs, and working dogs, although there are many other types and subtypes. Breeds listed here may be traditional breeds with long histories as registered breeds, rare breeds with their own registries, or new breeds that may still be under development.The following list uses a wide interpretation of "breed".

In addition, dog breed groups, which kennel clubs use to organize breeds of dogs, are based on dog types such as hound or terrier. Some group categories cover more than one type; working dog refers to dogs that do some sort of work for humans, in contrast to companion dogs which are pets, although working dogs can also be companions, and companion dogs can do useful work. The terminology is unclear; see Working Group and Utility Group. Mixed-breed dogs can have any combination of working and companion functions and be of any type. Toy dogs are very small dogs of any type. See Toy Group. Ancient dog breeds are modern breeds genetically identified as descending from very old types of various kinds, and would fit into multiple categories.The following are dog types and subtypes. A single type of dog may have been developed for multiple sorts of work, so there is some overlap. Broad categories are listed first, then sub-types.

For a list of individual dog breeds, see List of Dog Breeds.Dogs have been selectively bred for thousands of years, sometimes by inbreeding dogs from the same ancestral lines, sometimes by mixing dogs from very different lines.[1] The process continues today, resulting in a wide variety of breeds, hybrids and types of dog. Dogs are the only animal with such a wide variation in appearance without speciation, "from the Chihuahua to the Great Dane".[2]The following list uses a wide interpretation of "breed". Breeds are usually categorized by the functional type from which the breed was developed. The basic types are companion dogs, guard dogs, hunting dogs, herding dogs, and working dogs, although there are many other types and subtypes. Breeds listed here may be traditional breeds with long histories as registered breeds, rare breeds with their own registries, or new breeds that may still be under development.The following list uses a wide interpretation of "breed".

In addition, dog breed groups, which kennel clubs use to organize breeds of dogs, are based on dog types such as hound or terrier. Some group categories cover more than one type; working dog refers to dogs that do some sort of work for humans, in contrast to companion dogs which are pets, although working dogs can also be companions, and companion dogs can do useful work. The terminology is unclear; see Working Group and Utility Group. Mixed-breed dogs can have any combination of working and companion functions and be of any type. Toy dogs are very small dogs of any type. See Toy Group. Ancient dog breeds are modern breeds genetically identified as descending from very old types of various kinds, and would fit into multiple categories.The following are dog types and subtypes.
