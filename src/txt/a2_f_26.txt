Turkish diet habits

The Turkish cuisine is millenarian, as well as the Turkish alimentary habits. Turkish recepies passes from grandmother-mother-daughter since generations and they are very traditional in their diet habits. Turks doesn't like much to try different kinds of food.

Beginning with a very oriental breakfast.... bread, olives, tomatos, cucumberes, white cheese, honey and black turkish tea. At the weekend some families can add to the table: an omelet or boiled egg, borek (pie filled with vegetables, meat or cheese), sucuk or pastirma (Turkish salamis), butter or fresh cream, marmalades, etc...

The lunch is served between 12:00 and 13:00 in the normal work days . In big cities people do not go back home for lunch. There is usually restaurants in big companies. Meals are generally simple but Turkish cookery. At street restaurants you can see Turkish typical dishes that can be chosen at self-service restaurants without having to wait a long time to be served.

We can separate the turkish dishes in 5 types: soups, cold dishes, hot dishes & meats (main dishes) and dessert.
	
Turkish diet habits 
Turks love soup, even in the summer some turks eat hot soup. Some soups: yogurt soup, red lentil soap, tomato soap, sheep soap with yogurt, etc... Turks eat lots of bread with soup and all
other dishes.

Usually the colds Turkish dishes are eaten in the summer. The colds dishes are delicious, usually it doesn't have meat but lots of fresh vegetables like: leek with carrots, green paprikas filled with rice, fresh green beans, yogurt salads (eggplant or carrot), chicken with walnut sauce, etc... During the summer Turks eat a dish called cacik, which is a cold soup made of yogurt, cucumber and herbs.
The Turkish hot dishes (main dishes) usually have some meat on it and a lot of vegetables, however the Southwest population eats more meat. You can eat in Turkey fried eggplant with meat, spinach with yogurt, pepper filled with rice and milled meat covered with yogurt, etc...

You will also be able to eat sis kebap in Turkey, that are small barbecues in wood stick (beef, sheep or chicken - due to religion you won't find pork in Turkish restaurants). The doner kebap (translated literally means beef that rotates - because beef is piled up and it rotates around itself when cooking) it is a good dish to ask for. You can eat it with french fries and salad, or you can eat the beef as sandwich.

In all Turkish meals you will find bread: in breakfast, lunch or dinner. The yogurt is also very used as a cream over certain dishes.

As dessert you can eat a turkish sweet: baklava (special sweet with all kinds of nuts), rice pudding, chocolate pudding or muse, asure, chicken pudding.... Turks also love seansons fruits and they eat plenty of it. During the summer they eat cherries, peaches, grapes, watermelon and
melon... and during the winter orange, apples and pears.

During the whole day Turks drink black traditional Turkish tea in small glasses. You can see in the whole country Turks drinking black tea. It is the most popular non alcoholic and traditional drink in Turkey, followed by the turkish coffee. The snack during the afternoon can be done with a tea
and a simit (small round bread with sesame over it) or piece of cake or cookie. Turks love all flour products. Some other tipical Turkish drinks:sahlep, boza and ayran.

Dinner is usually made at home with the family. The housewives love to cook and they make it very well. Due to rush of the daily life, women who work prepares easy turkish dishes. The dinner menu would be a repetition of what can be eaten at lunch or for some families only a snack.

During the weekends Turks eat in restaurants or use to visit some friends.Usually when they visit friends they would find a banquet, the housewife works hardly to satisfy her guests. You should try to eat everything otherwise the housewife will not be satisfied.

Turks drink beer but the most popular alcoholic drink is Raki, made of anises. This drink is
served in two long glasses. In one glass they put water with ice until the top, in the other the raki until the middle of the glass. The person who is drinking keep on mixing the water to the raki. Raki is transparent but when in contact with water gets a whitish color. The drink has high alcoholic content.

For the curious people who would try the Turkish cuisine we suggest in our site some books. Have fun!

Soccer teams in Turkey

Although Turkey doesn't have a soccer tradition as Brazil, Germany, England or Italy, Turks are fanatic for soccer. This fanaticism began in Turkey with the national soccer championships. There are several soccer teams in Turkey and every year there is a national soccer championship. The main soccer teams are: Besiktas, Fenerbahce, Galatasaray, Trabzon Spor...

The soccer championships usually take place in Istanbul. Each club has his own soccer stadium. The stadiums have medium capacity and some have first class service. Everything depends on the team's financial situation. Soccer marketing has turned into a great business in Turkey. They sell everything from shirts, caps, teams' footballs to complete bedrooms for children using the colors of the club. The soccer players' salary are like the Europeans, depending of course of the financial situation of each team.

Turks like a lot to play soccer and there are many soccer fields spread around Istanbul. In summer time, games take place usually at night because of the heat, but Turks don't stop playing soccer in winter where the temperature can reach 3 C. Friends divide the expenses in a game by paying the rent of the soccer field.

Taking the third place in the World soccer cup 2002, Turks became more soccer fanatic. Trainer Senol Gunes was very criticized by the Turks but he showed how good their football is for the whole world. To commemorate the return of the turkish soccer team, there was a big party done in Istanbul to receive the Turkish players mobilizing thousands of people from the airport to the central part of the city called Taksim.

Turkish culture shock

Turkish culture shock for foreigners that come to visit or to live in Turkey:

    Walking on the street you see two men walking hand in hand or hugged. Then they stop and they meet another man and they kisses each other in the face. These men are not homosexuals. Friends walk through the street hand in hand or hugged. This is very common all over Turkey. Greeting with kisses are also common among the men!

    If you rent a car in Turkey, drive carefully. Pedestrians cross the streets while cars are passing. Drivers have to be very careful with pedestrians. In busier Istanbul districts the situation can be chaotic. The famous "zebra cross" does not work in Turkey.

    Don't get scared if you wake up with in the middle of the night with a speaker. Muslims call for prayer 5 times a day and one of them is at sunrise!

    Money in Turkey is called "Turkish Lira" and it has a lot of zeros... in a small shop one coca-cola coast a million turkish lira... a house would cost some trillions of turkish lira... we are all millionaires!!

    In some turkish religious neighborhoods you can see women all dressed in black. In Istanbul you can also see women with colorful handkerchiefs covering their head and also modern women that dress as Europeans. The garment is part of the women's religiosity, therefore the more religious a person is, the more rigorous the garment. With men it is harder to notice the religiosity through clothes. You can see a man that seams to you totally normal, but he can be a religious man. If a man has beard or it is using a cap (white) or a turban (white, green or black) that means that he is religious. In some mosques they give a cloth for the women to cover their legs (if they are using shorts) and also to cover their arms if they are using short sleeves. They give the men the same cloth to cover themselves if they are using shorts.

    There is a public transport in Turkey that is called "dolmus". It is like a small bus, they stop in any point to leave or to take passengers. You pay the price from the place you get into the dolmus until your destiny. The prices is different for each person, depending on where they took the dolmus. The payment is made directly to the driver. When sitting in a dolmus, sit at the back seat otherwise you will have to pass the money and repeat the destiny of the other passengers to the driver.

    Street vendors are very common in Turkey, they usually sell cheap products. Sometimes we see some street vendors running from the police, in this case they don't have authorization to sell at the street. The authorization is given by the city hall when requested.

    Turks love to do picnic. I would say that it is the "national sport". At the weekends you can see whole families in parks and squares. They bring everything for a barbecue, from a rug or cloth to cover the ground to a barbecue grill and little stove for the tea.

    This can be a reason to get a flu for many the Turks: to take wind (to be close to a open window with wind), to go to the street after taking a bath and washed the head with wet hair (even in the summer! in winter I think just a crazy one would go to the street with wet hair at zero degrees Celsius...), to have barefoot (at home stepping in ceramic or even in the wood), to sweat and later to take a wind...

    Popular Turkish believes: you should not eat fish with yogurt... you can get poisoned...

    Another Popular Turkish belief: a person should not give a knife directly to another person. The knife should be put over the table and the other person should get the knife. If by chance the person forgets and she gives the knife directly for the other person, the person that receives the knife should spit over the knife. This "spit over the knife" protects against a discord among themselves.

    Restaurants usually expose their food. That is great for the foreigners so that they can see and choose what to eat! The foods are usually seasoned, with a lot of vegetables and not much meat. Turks eat a lot of fruits and sweets in Turkey.

Although quite a number of years have passed over the official declaration on the elimination of discrimination against women by the United Nations and although 1975 has official been declared as the International Women's Year, yet we cannot say that in the year 2003 the major economic, social educational and family problems of women have been solved in its real sense neither in the developed countries nor in the developing countries.

The recorded history of the Anatolian peninsula goes back to the 2nd millenium B.C. The ancient tablets found, belonging to those eras bear such inscriptions which inform us on the social and marital status of women as well as their daily lives and their legal rights. These samples of history indicate that the women of those times enjoyed an exalted social position. They did not hide behind veils, nor kept themselves away from certain tasks done by men. They were in constant company of their husbands or relatives at homes, tends, wagons or horseback. Rights and responsibilities were shared and women represented together with men, the tribal integrity and authority of the state.

During the first centuries of Islam, beginning 7th century A.D., women were still equal with men. Mohammed, the prophet had his wife Hatice ride with him through the battle fields. She was faithful and wise consultant to the prophet. Fadima, the daughter of the prophet, enjoyed the same equality with her husband Ali, one of the disciples of the prophet who became the 4th caliph of Islam.

During the Seljuk Empire women had equal rights and rank to men. Quite a number of Seljuk monuments still existing in Anatolia bear the names of Seljuk women. Those monuments were erected by those women themselves or by the Seljuk community in their memory.

With the Islam and permission of polygamy, the woman status changed. Religion laws gave way to opportunists who degraded the rights of women. While in big cities women could not even be seen in the streets walking with anybody except her husband, the conception of behavior in Anatolia among the nomad women was quite different. The nomad woman was not suffering from the misinterpreted faith of the Islam but helping her husband in the fields, in sheep raising, in cattle breeding, dairly farming, etc. Prior to Ataturk and his reforms, the first movement to regain social and educational rights of women started right after the ottoman reformation which took place in 1839 with the declaration of a creed caled in Turkish "Gulhaney-i Hatti Humayun" which with a literary translation means "The royal creed of Gulhane". This declaration which aimed to the modernization of the Empire was fostered by the Grand Vizier (Prime Minister) of the time K. Resit Pasa. The emancipation of women was heard from a handful of intellectuals, including women writers and poets. By this time there was a minority of enlightened women in Istanbul who had been exposed to western culture and were dissatisfied with their suppressed status. These movements expanded among big cities of Anatolia but hardly reached the rural areas. That is why in reviewing the status of women in Turkey one should not forget to make distinction between the urban woman and the rural woman. The rural woman compromise 72% of the female population.

The first movement to regain social and educational rights of women started in 1839. The junior high schools for girls started being opened. This step was initially taken in Istanbul in 1858. Late in 1869, schools were open.The prominent poets and writes of the time, between 1827 and 1895 never ceased satirizing in their works, the bride and the groom never having seen each other previously.

The period of constitutional monarchy in Turkish history (1908) was full of wars and defeats, yet this period witnessed enormous intellectual affords. A social movement was initiated in favor of liberty, equality, education of women, monogamy and a place for woman in social life. The ottoman Empire was founded in the year 1299 and existed in history for 623 years, it come into a downfall in 1922. Turkish women ( or Ottoman women) started the emancipation movement in the first half of the 19th century. The movement also included men who were in favor of emancipation of women. At that time there was a small minority of enlighten women in Istanbul, then the capital of the Ottoman Empire, who had been exposed to western culture and fervent supports of change. To these effects the first women's periodical was entitled TERAKKI which means PROGRESS. This magazine appeared In 1869, In 1870 the first Teacher's Training College for Women was established. With the second constitution in the year 1908 at,the time of Sultan Abdul Hamid the Second, secondary schools for girls were founded and for the first time the University of Istanbul admitted women in a separate department for the training of secondary school teachers. The year was 1915.
	
Village Women
During the Balkan War (1912-1913) and the 1st World War (1914-1918) some Turkish women entered labor markets, municipal and administrative services replacing the men who went to the front. They also took jobs in hospitals doing voluntary work. They dressed less rigidly in the public and the veil covering their faces became more transparent. This picture was true for the urban elite and urban middle classes because the majority of women who lived in rural areas, shared the hard work of men in the fields.

Turkish women were also very active during the Turkish War of Independence (1918-1923). These women who look an active part in the War of Independence will always be remembered by the Republic with deep respect and pride. Several of them became famous for acts of patriotism; but, as in every national struggle countless more, unknown women contributed their bit without which the war might well have failed. With the country under occupation, they helped organize protest meetings and marches in cities and towns and prayers in every mosque. As the war developed, they picked up the work of the men in the fields, trundled food and ammunition to the soldiers at the front and nursed the wounded. Some even were soldiers themselves.

The first organized women's revolutionary movement in Anatolia took place in Erzurum (north eastern part of Turkey). The second mass movement was the foundation of the ANADOLU KADINLARI MODAFAA-I VATAN CEMIYETI (Anatolian Women's for Patriotic Defense). This Association held a meeting in Sivas at 1919 calling for all Turkish women to exercise close cooperation. Women flocked to join this organization and its support was greatly appreciated by the Grand National Assembly seated in Ankara. The Association was very active during the war in helping the resistance movement, in making large scale contributions and in protesting vigorously against the occupation.

On the other hand Anatolian peasant women took a very active part in the war of independence. They carried ammunition, cannon balls on their shoulders to the battle fields. They even organized military attacks.

The full emancipation of Turkish women took place after the proclamation of the Turkish Republic
in 1923. This was because of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk founder of modern Turkey who made the
advancement of women, a central aim of his social, religious and legal reforms by means of which he transformed Turkey into a Western Democracy. Thus, after hundreds of years of waiting and striving Turkish women have been able to realize their potential, Under the leadership of Ataturk
and his colleagues, laws recognizing the principles of equal citizenship were passed. 
In his public speeches Ataturk made this very clear, In 1923 he said "If our nation now needs sciences and knowledge, men and women must share them equally. Obviously society creates a division of labor, and in this division women should carry out their own duties as well as contribute to the general effort to improve the happiness and well-being of our society."

In old days our forefathers were aware of this fact, and our history bears witness to the zeal, the abilities and virtue of Turkish women. Perhaps the most important quality they possessed was that of bringing up their children to be worthy citizens. Our nation was powerful in Asia as well as in Europe, and the brilliance of our history is due to those maternal influences which enable talented children to be educated and inspired by a true sense of honor and courage. I would emphasize again that, apart from the public responsibilities they bear, women have the highly important duty of being successful mothers.

The adoption of a new civil law in 1926 based on the Swiss Civil Code was the most important of Ataturk's reforms which tremendously effected the status of Turkish women. Providing equality before the law, it also replaced religious marriage with civil marriage, made polygamy illegal and gave women equal rights of inheritance, guardianship of children and divorce. Previously, Turkish men could have as many as four wives at a time, and divorce them at will with no recourse to legal action. When the Military law was discussed at a debate in the Grand National Assembly in 1927 the subject of eligibility of men for the office of deputy arose. Every speaker came out in favor of granting women the right to vote and to be elected to office. But still there was no movement to amend the electoral laws. Four years later, in 1930 when public opinion had been prepared for change, the municipal electoral laws were modified.

On the 5th of December 1934 a law concerning the election rights of women was debated in the Grand National Assembly, It had been signed by 191 of the deputies as it was presented. The bill for the new legislation is highly important in Turkish history and for the women of Turkey because it proposed that:

1. Every Turkish citizen who has reached the age of twenty-two, man or woman alike, has the right to vote in general elections.

2. Every Turkish citizen thirty years of age or older, man or woman alike is eligible for election to parliament.

Today men in Turkey make up nearly one half of the country's rapidly increasing population. % 53 of the population is urban and % 47 represents those who live in rural areas. However we cannot consider this ratio as static because there is a rapid immigration from rural to urban areas. Although family planning has been a state policy since 1965 only in 1983 a new law was adopted which enables women to exercise their birth control rights, and makes abortion legal under certain conditions.

In education, according to 1995 census, the literacy rate of women is 75% versus 89% for men. This literacy rate of women is remarkable when compared with the literacy rate of men back in 1935 when it was only 9.8%

Today, in professional and academic activity, Turkish women are at an exceptionally high level. In the prestigious professions which are generally considered men's domain such as law, medicine, engineering, architecture, they have excelled their counter-parts.

On March 1st, 1935, eighteen women deputies were elected to the Grand National Assembly. In the years following 1935, a total of 102 women have been elected to the parliament. Some of them served for successive terms.Most of those elected to the Parliament have come from the teaching profession. They have been both primary school teachers and university professors. The second largest group have been lawyers. Medical doctors formed the third largest professional group. Women deputies in Parliament have always shown great interest in every aspect of public life, but they have particularly been active in public health, education, care for the elderly and child welfare.

An analytical survey conducted in 1989 shows that of the 30.000 members in 30 universities there are women chairholders, deans and institute directors. They have served as university president and member of higher Education Council. Studies show that academic women are not faced with sex discrimination in their careers.

As to women in politics: According to the United Nations studies in 1989, at the cabinet level, only %3,5 of the ministries in 155 countries are held by women. Out of those 155 countries 99 countries have no women ministers. In 1989 elections Prof. Tansu Ciller a woman professor of economics and a parliamentarian was elected to the prime minister's office in Turkey.

In 1985 Turkey signed the UN Convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women.

Today Turkey has a government sponsored general directorate under a woman minister which is
charged with women's affairs. A woman's research and Education Center is in operation at the Istanbul University since 1990.The principal aim of this center is to initiate and support research on woman's position in social life, in politics and in legal system. Women's non-governmental organizations, on the other hand, follow up loosely the implementation of legislation related to women, making recommendation for improvements.

In conclusion we can say that the status of women in Turkey doesn't represent a homogeneous
image. There are variations which are based on location, educational level, and socio-economic factors. These differences are sharply notable between rural and urban women. Traditional patriarchal family pattern is still the rule in rural areas, although urbanization and exposure to mass media are having their effects . However I must clearly point out that in Turkey's rapid economic growth, social development with the oriental and occidental hemispheres Turkish women hold a large share of pride and dignity.

I wish to close my paper by quoting from Ataturk the following lines: "There is a straighter and more secure path for us to follow than the one we have been. This is to have turkish women as partners in everything, to share our lives with them, and to value them as friends, helpers and colleagues in our scientific, spiritual, social and economic life."

This text was part of the seminar "Turkish Women, a brief historical survey" kindly given by Ayse
Cebesoy Sarialp at the Turkish-American University Association & Universities Cultural and Educational Foundation for the IWI (International Women of Istanbul) members in Istanbul.
Turkey is a secular country, that means religion and state are separated. What is valid for religion may not be valid for the state. Marriage is one of the points which religion and state think in a different way. The muslim religion accepts that a man can marry more than a woman. The Turkish civil code does not accept it, a man can marry just one woman.

A Turkish man can marry more than a woman if he regards just the muslim religion. He should provide all his wifes the same lifestyle and care. He can not marry more than a woman legally.
The majority of Turkish men are married just with one woman. There are cases which you can find a man living together with more than one wife but this is not common. Since the foundation of the Turkish republic by Ataturk the civil law has been changed and accepted by the population.

If a man wants to marry a woman, both must prepare all documents to be approved and wait for the wedding day. Foreigners can marry a Turkish man or a woman and also gain a Turkish citizenship if they want and accept it.

Turkish people would rather marry in summer, spring or autumn, but almost never in winter. For the civil marriage there are special places all over the city. In those "marriage offices" in almost every 15 minutes there is a marriage. These places are usually big and located in central districts of the city. There is usually a big ballroom with a lot of chairs for the guests to sit down. In a stage there is a table with 5 chairs. The bride and groom sit together in a corner, two witness from the couple in another one and the judge of civil courts who will marry them in another one. So these 5 persons will be seen in the stage by the audience. 

Turkish Gold Coins
	The bride usually wears a white wedding gown and the groom usually wears a suit. The witnesses and guest are usually well dressed for the occasion. The ceremony is very simple: the judge asks the bride and groom's name, birthday date, place of birth and their father's name, after that he asks if the bride and groom accept to marry each other. After the "yes" there is usually a lot of applause from the audience which gets excited and happy about the event. So the ceremony ends the married couple will go out of the ballroom an the next couple will come in... it is unbelievable how many marriages they make pro day in some districts of Istanbul. Usually weekends are most requested days to get married.

The bride and groom than moved to another room to be congratulated by family and guests. The family usually give as gifts: gold coins, gold jewelry and money as. Gold coins usually have a red ribbon and it is put with a pin over the bride's weeding dress. Money will be also added with a pin. At the end of the greetings the bride will be covered with gold, jewelry and money. The quantity of gold and money will depends on the family's wealthy. The bride usually caries a small bag where she can keep some of the gold, jewelry and money she received.

After the greetings there is usually a party where people will enjoy good food and music. Honeymoon is also an usual event and the bride and groom might go to a beautiful place to celebrate their marriage. 

Blue Mosque
	The Fast of Ramadan

Ramadan is not a fix holiday that changes its date every year and it is located in the ninth month of the Muslim calendar. The Month of Ramadan is also when it is believed the Holy Quran "was sent down from heaven, a guidance unto men, a declaration of direction, and a means of Salvation". It is during this month that Muslims fast. It is called the Fast of Ramadan and lasts the entire month. Ramadan is a time when Muslims concentrate on their faith and spend less time on the concerns of their everyday lives. It is a time of worship and contemplation.

During the Fast of Ramadan strict restraints are placed on the daily lives of Muslims. They are not allowed to eat or drink during the daylight hours. Smoking and sexual relations are also forbidden during fasting. At the end of each day the fast is broken with prayer and a meal called the "iftar". In the evening following the iftar it is customary for Muslims to go out visiting family and friends. The fast is resumed the next morning.

According to the Holy Quran: One may eat and drink at any time during the night "until you can plainly distinguish a white thread from a black thread by the daylight: then keep the fast until night".

The good that is acquired through the fast can be destroyed by five things: the telling of a lie, slander, denouncing someone behind his back, a false oath, greed or covetousness. These are considered offensive at all times, but are most offensive during the Fast of Ramadan
During Ramadan, it is common for Muslims to go to the Mosque and spend several hours praying and studying the Quran. In addition to the five daily prayers, during Ramadan Muslims recite a special prayer called the Taraweeh prayer (Night Prayer).

The Origin of Narghile.
Several hypotheses on the birthplace of narghile must be taken into account.They concern Europe, America, India, Persia and Africa. Those who try hard to write the official history of tobacco mention an American origin and a European origin for the transmission of its use modes, as the common pipe, the chibouque or even narghile. Such an argument states that the Europeans would have taught Asian and African peoples how to smoke, particularly through the pipe. A consequence is that cannabis would have been inhaled, neither in Europe, nor in Africa, nor anywhere else, before the arrival of tobacco.

The Narghile.
A water-pipe consists of various parts: The body, bowl, tube and mouthpiece:

Body: This is the part where the bowl is placed.It looks like a decanter. It is filled with water. This water cleans the soot belched out by the burning tobacco and also to absorb the nicotine.Though the body is usually made of glass or metal, you could find more elegant ones made out of porcelain with gold, silver or colorful paintings.

Bowl: Tobacco is put in the bowl which is pierced and covered with a conical cap in order that the flame be sheltered on windy days.

Tube: This is the tube where the smoke goes throught. There may be more than one tube so that two or more people can smoke together while chatting.

Mouthpiece: put at the end of the tube to smoke. 
Narghile Tobacco. The tobacco takes two or even three main forms. The first one is the mu'essel and literally means "honeyed", named so because of its ingredients like treacle (molasses) or honey used as agglutinant bonds. Treacle (molasses) is a sugar by-product. The second form is "tumbâk" which is pure tobacco. "Jurâk", mainly of Indian origin, can be considered as an intermediate substance among both first ones. It is very appreciated in the Arabian peninsula. Fruits and oils would be some of its ingredients.
Narghile in society.
Narghile is popular as well as with men as with women (but mostly smoked in Turkey by men), as well as with young people as with their elders. Indeed, it symbolizes conviviality, serenity and harmony. Narghile is something to be smoke in groups. Narghile smokers smoke in group to let conversation naturally take place among them. Narghile has a collective form practice even if it is sometimes individual.

	

Narghile in Turkey.
Water-pipes was brought to Anatolia in the 17th century. Today, Turkey is not any more that country where Pierre Loti, a great amateur of narghiles used to live. Today, those places fitted out to devote to this art, called "narghile bars", can be listed on one's fingers. Most of the famous cafés where the peculiar narghile atmosphere prevailed actually disappeared. But there are still some districts where the "survivors" are to be found in Istanbul: around the Grand Bazaar, in some tourist spots and in some specific districts of Istanbul. The narghile bars are surrounded with the smell of various narghile tobaccos (rose, mint, orange,etc.). While smoking, people would enjoy also a Turkish tea or Turkish coffee and would also play backgammon or cards. Tourist usually love the Turkish apple tea. No alcohol drink is served. Tourists are welcome and they would try to smoke narghile and enjoy the atmosphere of the coffee shop. 
Narghile at the Ottoman Empire. Social frontiers gave to some travelers the illusion of "class-less" societies in the Ottoman Empire. Nevertheless, one should know that this last one was extremely divided, according to social, professional or religious memberships. Such a social promiscuity even worried political and religious authorities. Moreover, their fears led to disastrous episodes of ban on cafés, coffee and tobacco by Sultan Murad IV who wanted this way to put an end to the transgression of limits between social groups. 
Narghile in the world.
Narghile is still used in various countries around the globe such as Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Greece, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Yemen, Iran, India, Afghanistan and China. In some of those countries narghile is more popular than in Turkey. Syria has a prosperous narghile industry which exports to many countries of the region an impressive variety of water vessels and other essential elements of the artifact. Today in Egypt, more than in any other, the narghile makes an exhibition of itself almost everywhere and in every place. An interesting question is to know if the powerful film production of this country, massively broadcast on the regional scale, has been in a position to influence smoking behaviors in other countries. Such behaviors would have been at the origin of a revival of narghile as in Tunisia, Syria, Lebanon or Jordan.

In current modern Iran, 
the narghile life-style continues. For instance, in Darban, a small town in the South of Teheran, women, alone or accompanied with their husband or mother, find the road of traditional tea-houses, in an atmosphere of holiday resort, delicious: sat down on a carpet, drink tea, eat sun flower seads, smoke a narghile and chat. India was known with the historic use of hookah. Narghile was in 1840, very common during dinners, at officers' tables, and its typical gurgling could be heard till late in the night. Old Indians even kept this custom when traveling abroad. The Chinese narghile has a very peculiar shape: it looks like a big and generally decorated lighter. Its little bowl is designed to embed tiny balls of tobacco smoked in two or three drafts.

Soccer teams in Turkey

Although Turkey doesn't have a soccer tradition as Brazil, Germany, England or Italy, Turks are fanatic for soccer. This fanaticism began in Turkey with the national soccer championships. There are several soccer teams in Turkey and every year there is a national soccer championship. The main soccer teams are: Besiktas, Fenerbahce, Galatasaray, Trabzon Spor...

The soccer championships usually take place in Istanbul. Each club has his own soccer stadium. The stadiums have medium capacity and some have first class service.

They sell everything from shirts, caps, teams' footballs to complete bedrooms for children using the colors of the club. The soccer players' salary are like the Europeans, depending of course of the financial situation of each team.

Turks like a lot to play soccer and there are many soccer fields spread around Istanbul. In summer time, games take place usually at night because of the heat, but Turks don't stop playing soccer in winter where the temperature can reach 3 C. Friends divide the expenses in a game by paying the rent of the soccer field.

Turkish culture shock

Turkish culture shock for foreigners that come to visit or to live in Turkey:

    Walking on the street you see two men walking hand in hand or hugged. Then they stop and they meet another man and they kisses each other in the face. These men are not homosexuals. Friends walk through the street hand in hand or hugged. This is very common all over Turkey. Greeting with kisses are also common among the men!

    If you rent a car in Turkey, drive carefully. Pedestrians cross the streets while cars are passing. Drivers have to be very careful with pedestrians. In busier Istanbul districts the situation can be chaotic. The famous "zebra cross" does not work in Turkey.

    Don't get scared if you wake up with in the middle of the night with a speaker. Muslims call for prayer 5 times a day and one of them is at sunrise!

    Money in Turkey is called "Turkish Lira" and it has a lot of zeros... in a small shop one coca-cola coast a million turkish lira... a house would cost some trillions of turkish lira... we are all millionaires!!

    In some turkish religious neighborhoods you can see women all dressed in black. In Istanbul you can also see women with colorful handkerchiefs covering their head and also modern women that dress as Europeans. The garment is part of the women's religiosity, therefore the more religious a person is, the more rigorous the garment. With men it is harder to notice the religiosity through clothes. You can see a man that seams to you totally normal, but he can be a religious man. If a man has beard or it is using a cap (white) or a turban (white, green or black) that means that he is religious. In some mosques they give a cloth for the women to cover their legs (if they are using shorts) and also to cover their arms if they are using short sleeves. They give the men the same cloth to cover themselves if they are using shorts.

    There is a public transport in Turkey that is called "dolmus". It is like a small bus, they stop in any point to leave or to take passengers. You pay the price from the place you get into the dolmus until your destiny. The prices is different for each person, depending on where they took the dolmus. The payment is made directly to the driver. When sitting in a dolmus, sit at the back seat otherwise you will have to pass the money and repeat the destiny of the other passengers to the driver.

    Street vendors are very common in Turkey, they usually sell cheap products. Sometimes we see some street vendors running from the police, in this case they don't have authorization to sell at the street. The authorization is given by the city hall when requested.

    Turks love to do picnic. I would say that it is the "national sport". At the weekends you can see whole families in parks and squares. They bring everything for a barbecue, from a rug or cloth to cover the ground to a barbecue grill and little stove for the tea.

    This can be a reason to get a flu for many the Turks: to take wind (to be close to a open window with wind), to go to the street after taking a bath and washed the head with wet hair (even in the summer! in winter I think just a crazy one would go to the street with wet hair at zero degrees Celsius...), to have barefoot (at home stepping in ceramic or even in the wood), to sweat and later to take a wind...

    Popular Turkish believes: you should not eat fish with yogurt... you can get poisoned...

    Another Popular Turkish belief: a person should not give a knife directly to another person. The knife should be put over the table and the other person should get the knife. If by chance the person forgets and she gives the knife directly for the other person, the person that receives the knife should spit over the knife. This "spit over the knife" protects against a discord among themselves.

    Restaurants usually expose their food. That is great for the foreigners so that they can see and choose what to eat! The foods are usually seasoned, with a lot of vegetables and not much meat. Turks eat a lot of fruits and sweets in Turkey.

Although quite a number of years have passed over the official declaration on the elimination of discrimination against women by the United Nations and although 1975 has official been declared as the International Women's Year, yet we cannot say that in the year 2003 the major economic, social educational and family problems of women have been solved in its real sense neither in the developed countries nor in the developing countries.

The recorded history of the Anatolian peninsula goes back to the 2nd millenium B.C. The ancient tablets found, belonging to those eras bear such inscriptions which inform us on the social and marital status of women as well as their daily lives and their legal rights. These samples of history indicate that the women of those times enjoyed an exalted social position. They did not hide behind veils, nor kept themselves away from certain tasks done by men. They were in constant company of their husbands or relatives at homes, tends, wagons or horseback. Rights and responsibilities were shared and women represented together with men, the tribal integrity and authority of the state.

During the first centuries of Islam, beginning 7th century A.D., women were still equal with men. Mohammed, the prophet had his wife Hatice ride with him through the battle fields. She was faithful and wise consultant to the prophet. Fadima, the daughter of the prophet, enjoyed the same equality with her husband Ali, one of the disciples of the prophet who became the 4th caliph of Islam.

During the Seljuk Empire women had equal rights and rank to men. Quite a number of Seljuk monuments still existing in Anatolia bear the names of Seljuk women. Those monuments were erected by those women themselves or by the Seljuk community in their memory.

With the Islam and permission of polygamy, the woman status changed. Religion laws gave way to opportunists who degraded the rights of women. While in big cities women could not even be seen in the streets walking with anybody except her husband, the conception of behavior in Anatolia among the nomad women was quite different. The nomad woman was not suffering from the misinterpreted faith of the Islam but helping her husband in the fields, in sheep raising, in cattle breeding, dairly farming, etc. Prior to Ataturk and his reforms, the first movement to regain social and educational rights of women started right after the ottoman reformation which took place in 1839 with the declaration of a creed caled in Turkish "Gulhaney-i Hatti Humayun" which with a literary translation means "The royal creed of Gulhane". This declaration which aimed to the modernization of the Empire was fostered by the Grand Vizier (Prime Minister) of the time K. Resit Pasa. The emancipation of women was heard from a handful of intellectuals, including women writers and poets. By this time there was a minority of enlightened women in Istanbul who had been exposed to western culture and were dissatisfied with their suppressed status. These movements expanded among big cities of Anatolia but hardly reached the rural areas. That is why in reviewing the status of women in Turkey one should not forget to make distinction between the urban woman and the rural woman. The rural woman compromise 72% of the female population.

The first movement to regain social and educational rights of women started in 1839. The junior high schools for girls started being opened. This step was initially taken in Istanbul in 1858. Late in 1869, schools were open.The prominent poets and writes of the time, between 1827 and 1895 never ceased satirizing in their works, the bride and the groom never having seen each other previously.

The period of constitutional monarchy in Turkish history (1908) was full of wars and defeats, yet this period witnessed enormous intellectual affords. A social movement was initiated in favor of liberty, equality, education of women, monogamy and a place for woman in social life. The ottoman Empire was founded in the year 1299 and existed in history for 623 years, it come into a downfall in 1922. Turkish women ( or Ottoman women) started the emancipation movement in the first half of the 19th century. The movement also included men who were in favor of emancipation of women. At that time there was a small minority of enlighten women in Istanbul, then the capital of the Ottoman Empire, who had been exposed to western culture and fervent supports of change. To these effects the first women's periodical was entitled TERAKKI which means PROGRESS. This magazine appeared In 1869, In 1870 the first Teacher's Training College for Women was established. With the second constitution in the year 1908 at,the time of Sultan Abdul Hamid the Second, secondary schools for girls were founded and for the first time the University of Istanbul admitted women in a separate department for the training of secondary school teachers. The year was 1915.
	
Village Women
During the Balkan War (1912-1913) and the 1st World War (1914-1918) some Turkish women entered labor markets, municipal and administrative services replacing the men who went to the front. They also took jobs in hospitals doing voluntary work. They dressed less rigidly in the public and the veil covering their faces became more transparent. This picture was true for the urban elite and urban middle classes because the majority of women who lived in rural areas, shared the hard work of men in the fields.

Turkish women were also very active during the Turkish War of Independence (1918-1923). These women who look an active part in the War of Independence will always be remembered by the Republic with deep respect and pride. Several of them became famous for acts of patriotism; but, as in every national struggle countless more, unknown women contributed their bit without which the war might well have failed. With the country under occupation, they helped organize protest meetings and marches in cities and towns and prayers in every mosque. As the war developed, they picked up the work of the men in the fields, trundled food and ammunition to the soldiers at the front and nursed the wounded. Some even were soldiers themselves.

The first organized women's revolutionary movement in Anatolia took place in Erzurum (north eastern part of Turkey). The second mass movement was the foundation of the ANADOLU KADINLARI MODAFAA-I VATAN CEMIYETI (Anatolian Women's for Patriotic Defense). This Association held a meeting in Sivas at 1919 calling for all Turkish women to exercise close cooperation. Women flocked to join this organization and its support was greatly appreciated by the Grand National Assembly seated in Ankara. The Association was very active during the war in helping the resistance movement, in making large scale contributions and in protesting vigorously against the occupation.

On the other hand Anatolian peasant women took a very active part in the war of independence. They carried ammunition, cannon balls on their shoulders to the battle fields. They even organized military attacks.

The full emancipation of Turkish women took place after the proclamation of the Turkish Republic
in 1923. This was because of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk founder of modern Turkey who made the
advancement of women, a central aim of his social, religious and legal reforms by means of which he transformed Turkey into a Western Democracy. Thus, after hundreds of years of waiting and striving Turkish women have been able to realize their potential, Under the leadership of Ataturk
and his colleagues, laws recognizing the principles of equal citizenship were passed. 
In his public speeches Ataturk made this very clear, In 1923 he said "If our nation now needs sciences and knowledge, men and women must share them equally. Obviously society creates a division of labor, and in this division women should carry out their own duties as well as contribute to the general effort to improve the happiness and well-being of our society."

In old days our forefathers were aware of this fact, and our history bears witness to the zeal, the abilities and virtue of Turkish women. Perhaps the most important quality they possessed was that of bringing up their children to be worthy citizens. Our nation was powerful in Asia as well as in Europe, and the brilliance of our history is due to those maternal influences which enable talented children to be educated and inspired by a true sense of honor and courage. I would emphasize again that, apart from the public responsibilities they bear, women have the highly important duty of being successful mothers.

The adoption of a new civil law in 1926 based on the Swiss Civil Code was the most important of Ataturk's reforms which tremendously effected the status of Turkish women. Providing equality before the law, it also replaced religious marriage with civil marriage, made polygamy illegal and gave women equal rights of inheritance, guardianship of children and divorce. Previously, Turkish men could have as many as four wives at a time, and divorce them at will with no recourse to legal action. When the Military law was discussed at a debate in the Grand National Assembly in 1927 the subject of eligibility of men for the office of deputy arose. Every speaker came out in favor of granting women the right to vote and to be elected to office. But still there was no movement to amend the electoral laws. Four years later, in 1930 when public opinion had been prepared for change, the municipal electoral laws were modified.

On the 5th of December 1934 a law concerning the election rights of women was debated in the Grand National Assembly, It had been signed by 191 of the deputies as it was presented. The bill for the new legislation is highly important in Turkish history and for the women of Turkey because it proposed that:

1. Every Turkish citizen who has reached the age of twenty-two, man or woman alike, has the right to vote in general elections.

2. Every Turkish citizen thirty years of age or older, man or woman alike is eligible for election to parliament.

Today men in Turkey make up nearly one half of the country's rapidly increasing population. % 53 of the population is urban and % 47 represents those who live in rural areas. However we cannot consider this ratio as static because there is a rapid immigration from rural to urban areas. Although family planning has been a state policy since 1965 only in 1983 a new law was adopted which enables women to exercise their birth control rights, and makes abortion legal under certain conditions.

In education, according to 1995 census, the literacy rate of women is 75% versus 89% for men. This literacy rate of women is remarkable when compared with the literacy rate of men back in 1935 when it was only 9.8%

Today, in professional and academic activity, Turkish women are at an exceptionally high level. In the prestigious professions which are generally considered men's domain such as law, medicine, engineering, architecture, they have excelled their counter-parts.
